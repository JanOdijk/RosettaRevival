\section{Introduction}
In this document the local M-rules (both surface rules and real M-rules) 
writtten for English and for Dutch are explained and discussed.
Also, some general decisions concerning local rules 
are documented. Most of these decisions were taken during the linguists' 
meeting of 
August 25, 1987, when document R0211 ({\em Local Dutch Rules. Documentation
\/})
was discussed. The rules themselves are not incorporated in this document. They 
can be found under [LOCALROS.ROSETTA3.`language'.WORK] rlocal*.mrule.

\section{Goal of Local M-rules}
The local rules as described in the current document are intended for the word 
translation mode,
i.e.\ when one word is entered into the computer, all suitable 
translations (consisting of as many words as necessary) should be returned. The 
intended user of such a system is someone who wants to know the translation of 
an unknown word encountered in a foreign text, rather than someone who is 
translating from his or her mother tongue into some other language. The latter 
user may refer to a dictionary more easily, since the dictionary form of a
word of one's own mother tongue is usually well-known, while the former user 
can only guess what the dictionary form of the unknow word is. However, the 
current form of the local rules still presupposes some 
knowledge of the foreign language in the case of 
prepositions, particles, reflexives etc. This point will be discussed in more 
detail in section 4 on Surface rules. 

It was decided to distinguish between rules used in the word translator and 
rules serving for robustness measures in the ordinary translation system, since 
both functions pose clearly different demands. Robustness rules require a 
strict adherence to the formulation of the complicated syntactic models used in 
the Rosetta M-rules, while for word translation simplified models suffice 
for correct translation. On the other hand, in word translation mode many more 
possibilities for translation need to be considered than in the robustness 
rules, where preferably only one translation is to be produced. The local rules 
described in this document are the rules for the word translator.

Given that the local rules have an independent status, it should be 
realised that the formulation of right models in the local rules is to a 
certain extent rather arbitrary, especially since there often is only one main 
rule working on an input word. Internal consistency of the rules can be 
reached easily. Indeed, the structure of  syntactic models has been simplified 
somewhat in the local rules as compared to the `real' M-rules, especially when 
this prevented the need for surface rules that should do 
nothing else but attach a new top node to a certain word or constituent of the 
source language. Decisions on the precise formulation of the in- and output 
models were sometimes made on a purely ad hoc basis, and remain open to 
criticism. Other peculiarities of the local rules are caused by the fact 
that all information about possible meanings of the input string must be 
derived from the string itself, and cannot be based on higher constituents.
For instance, in the local rules the form of the 
reflexive is determined by the form (person and number) of the verb, and not by 
any VAR (which is of course absent in the word translation mode) as in the
ordinary M-rules. 

The translations for the input string returned by the computer should comprise 
all semantic variants,
but not variants determined solely by `syntactic constraints'. For example, the 
attributive adjective {\em mooi} is generated in its dictionary form only, and 
not also in the form {\em 
mooie}, since there are no semantic reasons for distinguishing the two. Of 
course, {\em mooie} will be generated when a nominalised adjective is concerned
({\em Ik heb mooie en lelijke\/}), since there the -e ending is
meaningful. In analysis, attributive {\em mooie\/} is still accepted, since the 
user does not necessarily know that the final -e is determined by the following 
noun. Therefore, {\em mooie\/} will be ambiguous in analysis, but unambiguous 
when generated. 
When no base form is apparent, as in the case of an adjective which has both an 
inflectional and a periphrastic 
comparative, it was decided to generate both equivalents, since no clear 
grounds for selecting one of the two forms exist. 

No system for interactive disambiguation of
input strings is included in the present system yet, although the intention is 
to develop some bonus system that will only produce the most likely 
translation, and then ask the user whether more alternatives should be sought 
(cf.\ doc.\ 77, {\em User-interface specification of Rosetta3\/} and doc.\ 213, 
{\em The Transfer Modules of Rosetta3\/}).

\section{Organisation of the local M-rules}
Analytically speaking, the local M-rules take as input the output of the 
local surface rules. For most categories, no surface rules exist, since usually 
only one word may be entered into the computer, and not a whole phrase. For a 
description of the surface rules, see section 4.

The M-rules themselves are organised into one subgrammar per (basic) syntactic 
category, with the restriction that no rules (and hence no subgrammars) exist 
for categories that have no inflection or derivation, like CONJ, ART, COORD 
etc. The general strategy is not to translate words from one category
(e.g. the verb {\em to like\/}) into words of another category (e.g. the adverb 
{\em graag\/}) etc. Since the intention is 
to have the local rules work on the {\em Van Dale\/} tapes, where category 
mismatches are rare, there seems to be little problem in this strategy. One 
exception is made to the strategy just mentioned: it is assumed that composite 
verbs which 
consist of the verb `be' + an ADJ (or in Dutch: the verb `zijn' + an ADJ, e.g. 
{\em schuldig zijn\/} as translation of {\em owe\/}) are 
entered into the dictionary with only the ADJ, and not the verb. In the local 
rules for verbs, extra rules are added which introduce the verb 
syncategorematically when an ADJ is encountered as translation. These rules 
work only in generation (see section 5.1 on Verbs).

The Principle of Isomorphism is adhered to in the local M-rules as well.
This means that where the one 
language has a certain rule, the other should have a corresponding rule, even 
if the phenomenon does not occur in that language, e.g.\ English has an M-rule 
to decide the case of a BWHPRO ({\em who - whom\/}), while Dutch just has WHPROs 
that never change form. Therefore, the Dutch counterpart of the English rule is 
a vacuous one, that does not change the category of its input. Since 
there is only one rule in the Dutch subgrammar SGWhpro, 
the output of this subgrammar is the same as the input. Whether this can be 
dealt with by the 
formalism is as yet unclear (cf.\ document 101, where it is stated explicitly 
that the intersection of HEADCATs and EXPORTCATs is assumed empty). The local 
subgrammars do not always consist of just one rule; especially in the case of 
SGVerb, many transformations are included to determine the correct order of 
particles, verb, prepositions and reflexives.

No Transfer component has been written yet. However, in the documentation of the 
local M-rules the desired mapping is usually indicated. Local rules may be ambiguous, 
i.e.\ one rule in language A may map onto several rules in language B and vice 
versa. Since in the local rules not all rules are reversible (caused by the 
general constraint of a one word input, even though a several word output is 
allowed), the mapping is also not always 
reversible (e.g.\ the English rule which analyses and produces the POSSPRO 
{\em mine\/} is mapped, amongst others, onto a Dutch rule which produces {\em 
die van mij\/}, 
but this Dutch rule does not have a DECOMP part).


\section{Surface Rules}
Surface rules were necessary to allow for a multi-word input in specific cases. 
These cases are: reflexives (verbs: {\em zich schamen\/}, Dutch adjectives: 
{\em zich 
bewust (van)\/}), obligatory prepositions (verbs: {\em houden van\/}, adjectives: 
{\em aware of\/}), particles (verbs: {\em stand up, bel op\/}) and the article 
for superlatives of adverbs ({\em the earliest, het liefst\/}). For Dutch, an 
extra rule is added to allow possessive pronouns to take an article ({\em de 
mijne, het mijne\/}).

Some discussion took place on the need for these rules. Since it is 
undesirable to have to generate all translations of all verbs with the same 
stem (e.g.\ {\em houden, houden van, zich houden aan\/} etc.\ all have different 
translations in English), and since no (interactive) disambiguation with 
respect to meaning is included yet, it was decided to require the exact input 
needed for recognition of the appropriate meaning key. On the one hand, this is 
an advantage for the user, since just {\em kondigen\/} is now no longer 
accepted in analysis, and clear instructions can be presented to include all 
particles, prepositions and reflexives that can reasonably belong to the verb 
or adjective. On the other hand, the translation of {\em houden\/} will now 
only be {\em keep\/}, without any clue that when a preposition had been entered 
along with the verb, a completely different translation would have emerged. No 
user-friendly solution to this problem has been found yet.

Specific for 
English are some extra surface rules for the genitive of INDEFPROs and 
(PROPER)NOUNs (note that in 
English a genitive {\em 's\/} is considered a basic category, attached to the 
previous word by a glue rule, while in Dutch the {\em -s\/} ending is part of 
the inflection of a (proper)noun or indefpro). 

In the surface rules, a top category UTT is attached to either the basic 
category (in case of categories that are not dealt with in morphology, e.g.\ 
COORD, RECIPRO) or to the category that is produced by the other surface 
rules (e.g.\ ADJP, VERBP), or to the category that is produced by morphology 
(e.g.\ VERB, POSSPRO). Thus, the input (analytically speaking) to the M-rules 
is always a tree with top node UTT.

\section{M-rules}
In general, the local M-rules follow the lex-tree rules rather closely. 
However, extra rules are necessary for specific multi-word translations, and 
transformations are needed to spell out particles etc. Another difference with 
the lex-tree rules is the assumption that in generation no ambiguities 
will be produced, i.e.\ once a certain word is disambiguated in IL, only the 
unambiguous forms are dealt with in the generative M-rules. For example, the 
English personal pronoun {\em me\/} may be both an accusative and a dative. In 
IL, the form is mapped onto both possibilities, and the generative component 
will deal with these two independently, producing one {\em mij (acc)\/} and one 
{\em mij (dat)\/}. In implementation, certain measures may be taken to prevent 
the repetition of such identical output (note that the user cannot see that the 
two {\em mij\/}s are different, since the attribute values are not meant to be 
accessible to him or her). These measures are independent of the local rule 
system, and go beyond the scope of this paper.

In the 
sections below, the local subgrammars will be discussed, together with remarks 
on the most important rules in these subgrammars. Also, some links between 
Dutch and English rules will be indicated. In the
appendices, the subgrammar control expressions of all categories are 
enumerated, with the Dutch subgrammars in App.\ A and the English subgrammars 
in App.\ B. Note that in the rules 
described in this document, derivation is not taken into account. The rules 
are supposed to work on the output of the derivation subgrammars (from a 
generative point of view) and thus usually take a SUBX (X = ADJ, VERB etc.) as 
input.

\subsection{Verbs}
This is by far the largest subgrammar of the local rules. The body of the 
subgrammar is formed by rules that
form the present and past tense of indicatives, subjunctives and 
participles, and make infinitives and imperatives. In the case of adjectives 
being the translation of verbs, both Dutch and English have rules that 
introduce the verb {\em be\/} or {\em zijn\/}, e.g.\ {\em zich schamen 
$\rightarrow$ (be) ashamed; suffice $\rightarrow$ voldoende (zijn)\/}.

For Dutch, only the simple 
indicative form is recognised, with an alternative generative rule in the case 
of a verb with conjugation class 0 (these verbs do not have any conjugation, 
and the tenses are formed by means of the syncategorematically introduced 
progaux {\em zijn\/}, e.g.\ {\em glides $\rightarrow$ is aan het 
zweefvliegen\/}). For English, 
the simple tense is dealt with, but there are extra generative rules to produce 
the continuous tense as well (for non-stative verbs only). It is intended to 
have only one IL representation for present tense, and to map this one IL rule 
onto both Dutch and English 
indicative rules. It is assumed that 
no person 0 (inversion of verb + {\em je\/}) is recognised in IL. Dutch verb 
forms going with person 5 (gij) must be mapped onto English person 2, since it 
was decided not to deal with English person 5 (thou) at all, not even in 
analysis.

A problem exists for local translation of Dutch imperatives and infinitives. In 
English morphology, it is assumed that these two forms always completely 
coincide, so that the attribute `modus' can only have the value `infinitive', 
not a value `imperative'. However, when the form of a reflexive must be 
determined from the form of the verb, a distinction between the two modi
becomes necessary, since the infinitive takes {\em oneself\/}, while the 
imperative takes {\em yourself, yourselves\/}. In the ordinary M-rules, 
specification of the correct form is determined by the SENTENCE-node, which can 
be specified for mood. For the local rules, where such a higher node is lacking, 
the solution was sought in the 
introduction of a VERBP-node, which then is specified for numbers, [] 
representing an infinitive, and [singular] and [plural] the two imperatives. An 
alternative solution would have been to introduce the value `imperative' for 
the VERB-attribute `modus', with the restriction that this value may only be 
used in the M-rules and not in morphology. Both solutions seem very unelegant, 
but since a VERBP-node is also needed in other rules (when reflexives etc.\ are 
introduced), a choice for the first alternative seemed least  serious.

In the local rules, the Dutch subjunctive (in present tense: -e form of verbs, 
in past tense only {\em ware\/}) is dealt with in 
analysis only; the rules are mapped onto the English generative subjunctive 
rules. Note that these English rules are {\em not\/} reversible, to prevent the 
analysis of all verbs as both infinitive {\em and\/} subjunctive.

In line with what was mentioned in section 2 for adjectives, -e Forms of Dutch 
participles ({\em 
gekochte, stervende\/}) are accepted in analysis as possible variants of 
simple attributive `adjectives'. A problem exists for verbs that have their past 
participle ending in -en already: these verbs usually do not take an extra -e 
when used attributively ({\em $^{*}$de gehangene man\/}), but there is no 
attribute in verbs indicating this (the attribute `conjclass' is not 
sufficient; cf.\ adjectives, which have an attribute `eFormation'). No solution 
to this problem has been found yet. It is 
assumed that the Dutch present participle rule should be mapped onto the 
English ingForm rule, while the Dutch past participle rule corresponds to the 
English PastPart rule.

The correct placement of particles, prepositions and reflexives is accounted 
for by 
transformations, both in Dutch and in English. In Dutch, the relative position 
of the verb depends on whether one is dealing with a main clause word order or 
with a subordinate clause. It was decided to accept both orders in analysis, 
but to generate only main sentence word order. The choice of the correct form 
of the reflexive depends on the verb form. In generation, this is easy, since 
only unambiguous verb forms are produced anyway, but in analysis, a decision 
had to 
be formulated as to what combinations are still accepted. It was decided to 
accept verb forms that cannot be specified for a certain person or number 
(subjunctives, infinitives, participles) only 
with a neutral REFLPRO, i.e.\ `zich' for Dutch and `oneself' for English. This 
poses a quite severe constraint on the user of the local translation system, 
since he must be aware of the fact that he is dealing with such a verb form 
(in the text the combination may well be different: {\em Hij zei dat ik 
\underline{me wassen} moest\/}). However, even if all possible combinations of 
verb 
forms and reflpros were accepted, there still would be no way to preserve the 
information that the reflpro in the original text was {\em me\/}, since the 
spelling out of reflexives is done in a transformation, and not in a meaningful 
rule. Hence, the translation of {\em me wassen\/} would probably still be the 
neutral {\em wash oneself\/}, which is not very elegant either. 

Note that the 
form of the reflexive is used in analysis to disambiguate the verb form: once {
\em jezelf\/} has been recognised, {\em wast\/} can only be 2nd person, and is 
not ambiguous between 2nd and 3rd person anymore. A final point on reflexives 
is that in English, all subrules have been doubled to account for the fact that 
both direct and indirect object reflexives seem to exist ({\em avail oneself 
(of)\/} vs.\ {\em have oneself a good time\/}). If indirect object reflexives 
appear to occur only in idioms (which cannot be input to the local rules), 
these extra subrules can be removed.

A complication of the spelling out of neutral reflexives as mentioned above 
occurs in the English counterpart of the Dutch eORenForm-rules.
In Dutch, a rule exists to determine 
the eORenForm of nominalised participles ({\em de gehangene(n)\/}). The English 
counterpart of this rule, VerbNominalised, produces a translation with 
{\em ...one(s)\/}. 
However, in this context a reflexive should be spelled out as {\em himself, 
herself\/} or {\em itself\/} when the noun is singular ({\em one\/}), and 
{\em themselves\/} when the noun is plural ({\em ones\/}). The highly unelegant 
but easiest solution is to remove {\em oneself\/}, just spelled out in the 
reflexive transformation, and replace it by the correct form of 
the reflpro. Note that for the singular rule, all three forms just mentioned 
are indeed produced, since no criterion could be found to choose a specific 
one. Placement of the English VerbNominalised rule before the reflexive 
transformations might have been another solution, but then all reflexive, 
particle and preposition 
transformations would have to be doubled, allowing for very different input 
models, since the normal Verb rules produce VERB(P)s, while the VerbNominalised 
rule produces CNs.

\subsection{Nouns}

The rules produce singular and plural forms of nouns. In analysis, nouns that 
have 
[OnlyPlural] are only dealt with in the singular rule. It is assumed that nouns 
with 
[NoPlural] are also basically singular. In the generation part of the plural 
rule, extra CA-pairs are included to deal with those cases where a noun is a 
real plural in the source language, but an [OnlyPlur] or a [NoPlural] in the 
target language, e.g.\ {\em anti aircraft guns\/} [number = plural] 
$\rightarrow$ {\em afweergeschut\/} [number = singular]. This makes the M-rule 
for plural formation of Nouns asymmetric.

Propernouns that obligatorily take an article ({\em Rhine, Hebrides}) are listed 
as BNOUNs in the dictionary. Propernouns that only take an article when they 
are modified ({\em the beautiful Germany}) are converted into subnouns by the 
noun derivation subgrammar, and thus may also be input to the local Noun-rules.

The Noun rules also take care of genitive forms, both for English (where {\em 
's\/} is glued to the noun) and for Dutch (inflectional genitives). It is 
assumed that in Dutch an 
inflectional genitive can only occur for a limited number of singular nouns:
converted propernouns and the restricted set containing 
{\em moeder, (?)huis\/}. An even more restricted set of nouns (those of the 
former rule ending in -s when plural) also takes an 
inflectional genitive when plural ({\em ouders'\/}).
Other Dutch nouns get a periphrastic phrase with {\em van de/het\/}. For 
English, no periphrastic genitive rules have been formulated, even though not 
all nouns seem to accept a genitive {\em 's\/}. Since English nouns do not have 
an attribute `possgeni', restrictions on the occurrence of the genitive can 
only be formulated on independent grounds.

\subsection{Propernouns}

It was decided to allow for singular propernouns only; all plural propernouns 
must be formed by prior conversion to SUBNOUNs. Even though the singular rules 
also deal with [OnlyPlur] Propernouns, in the same way the Noun rules do, it is 
doubtful whether [OnlyPlur] propernouns exist, since they all seem to take an 
article and hence are listed as BNOUNs in the dictionary. 

Genitive formation of singular 
propernouns is allowed both in Dutch and in English. Dutch has an extra rule 
for periphrastic genitives with {\em van de/het\/}. The Propernoun rules are an 
exact replica of the singular Noun rules. This also implies that all singular 
Propernouns will be ambiguous between NOUN and PROPERNOUN, even in the local 
rules.

\subsection{Adjectives}

The Adjective rules take care of positives, comparatives and superlatives of 
adjectives. In Dutch, positives and comparatives may have NoForm or sForm ({\em
vlug(s), vlugger(s)}). In analysis, -eForm of (attributive) adjectives is also
accepted, but this form is not generated (cf.\ the remarks made in section
2). It is assumed that Dutch sForm adjectives can simply be translated into
ordinary English adjectives. Whether this mapping should be symmetric, i.e.\ 
whether all English adjectives must also be translated into an sForm of a Dutch 
adjective ({\em beautiful $\rightarrow$ mooi, moois\/}) has not been decided 
yet.

It is assumed that adjectives that are [NoComp] in one language 
will also be [NoComp] in other languages ({\em houten - wooden}), since this 
attribute-value is probably caused by semantic constraints that hold over 
all languages. The rules 
also introduce {\em meer/more\/} and {\em meest/most\/} for adjectives that 
also or only take
a periphrastic comparative and superlative. This is especially needed for 
translation from Dutch into English, since English has only few adjectives that 
take an inflectional comparative and superlative ({\em mooier - more beautiful
\/}). It is unclear whether the Dutch periphrastic rule will ever be needed. 
The Dutch AllerSuperlative is 
analysed only; in IL, only one superlative is recognised.

The Dutch AdjeORen rule produces -e and -en endings for adjectives that are 
used nominalised in all degrees of comparison. Just as for participles of 
verbs, the English counterparts of these rules produce periphrastic structures 
with {\em one(s)}, except in those rare cases where the English adjective has 
`nominalised' as one of the values for its attribute `uses' ({\em the rich, the 
wealthy\/}). It is assumed that this nominalisation rule only works for plural 
adjectives, and therefore need only be mapped onto the Dutch -enForm ({\em the 
wealthy - de welgesteldeN\/}).

Transformations are added to spell out the preposition going with the adjective 
({\em genegen tot, aware of\/}), and for Dutch an extra transformation is 
included to deal with a reflexive adjective (only example found so far: {\em 
zich bewust van\/}). The only order of reflexive, verb and preposition 
allowed, both in analysis and in generation, 
is the standard one, i.e. {\em zich bewust van\/} is accepted, but {\em zich 
van ... bewust\/} is not. For English, the AdjNominalised + Prep rule reverses 
the order of the output string: {\em green one\/} vs.\ {\em one aware of\/}.

\subsection{Adverbs}

The rules for adverbs rather resemble the rules for adjectives. Adverbs can 
also form comparatives and superlatives, both inflectional and periphrastic, 
but an sForm of adverbs does 
not exist. Whether English has any inflectional comparatives or superlatives 
for adverbs while 
Dutch needs a periphrastic form is even more doubtful than it was for 
adjectives. However, the appropriate rule has been included just in case.
The superlative of adverbs takes the obligatory article {\em het/the\/}:
{\em het liefst, het meest priv\'{e}; the most quickly}. In analysis, 
superlatives with and without 
article are both allowed. Again, Dutch allerSuperlatives are accepted in 
analysis only.

With adverbs, only Dutch superlatives may have -e endings ({\em het liefst(e) 
willen}). These -e endings are only accepted in analysis; they are not 
generated. It is assumed that only inflectional superlatives can take a final 
-e; periphrastic superlatives of adverbs cannot. 

\subsection{Personal Pronouns}

It was decided not to deal with the English person 5 ({\em thou\/}), since this
would require extra rules for verb morphology as well, to deal with all the
verb forms going with person 5 ({\em thou knowest\/, etc.}). Therefore, the
Dutch PERSPRO {\em U\/} must be mapped onto the English {\em you\/}. Reduced
forms of Dutch perspros ({\em 'm, me\/}) are accepted in analysis, but will not 
be generated, except for
generalised {\em je (one, you)\/} and {\em ze (they)\/}. Note that the 
existence of the generalised {\em je\/} and {\em ze\/} causes all occurrences 
of English {\em you\/} and {\em they\/} to be ambiguous, even in the local 
rules. The Dutch generalised {\em je\/} has as one of its translations the 
English IndefPro {\em one\/}, so that the Dutch PersPro rule must also be 
mapped onto the English IndefPro rule. 

As was mentioned in section 2, only
unambiguous forms are generated with respect to case: even though the input is
{\em him (acc,dat)\/}, the output will be {\em hem (acc)\/} and {\em hem
(dat)\/}. 

\subsection{Possessive Adjectives}

The Dutch rules accept reduced forms in analysis, but generate only full 
possessive 
adjectives. It is assumed that morphology recognises the possadjs of 
generalized reduced perspros {\em je\/} and {\em ze\/}
({\em je\/} and {\em hun\/}, respectively) as unreduced forms. Note that 
the Dutch PossAdj {\em je\/} has as one of its translations the English IndefPro {\em 
one's\/}, so that the Dutch possadj rule must also be mapped onto the English 
IndefProGeni rule.
{\em Onze\/} is also only accepted in analysis; in generation, {\em ons\/} is 
produced.
For {\em het\/} no possessive forms exists; an extra 
rule is added to produce {\em ervan\/} as translation of English {\em its\/}. 
If possible translations of English {\em it\/} are the perspros {\em hij\/} 
and {\em zij\/}, the rules will automatically also produce {\em hem/haar\/} as 
translations of {\em its\/}.

The third Dutch possadj rule accounts for the genitive forms of possessive 
adjectives ({\em mijner\/} etc.). Generalized personal pronouns, {\em jullie\/}  and 
{\em het\/} do not have this form. The English version of this rule works only 
in generation, and produces a phrase with {\em of my\/} etc.

\subsection{Possessive Pronouns}

In Dutch, two separate rules have been formulated,
since the 
translation of English PossPros needs an article {\em mine $\rightarrow$ de/het
mijne\/}, while in analysis a posspro without an article is accepted as 
well ({\em mijne\/}). A third translation of English posspros is a phrase with 
{\em van mij\/}, for cases like {\em This is mine\/}.
Generalized personal pronouns, {\em gij\/} and {\em het\/} do not form 
possessive pronouns. 
Since {\em jullie\/} does not have a posspro either, a 
fourth Dutch rule is added to generate {\em die/dat van mij, jullie\/} etc.\ as 
translation for English {\em mine, yours\/} etc. It could 
be argued that this rule should be reserved exclusively for the second person 
plural, since all other persons could be dealt with by the other rules; 
however, there seems to be no harm in a few extra translations for the 
other persons.

No rule is formulated for -enForms of Dutch possessive pronouns, since the 
meaning of e.g.\ {\em de mijnen\/} seems not to be 
a plural form of {\em de mijne\/}, but can 
roughly be paraphrased as {\em those who are near to me\/}. Consequently,
{\em de mijne\/} is ambiguous between singular and plural 
reference. 

\subsection{Wh Possessive Adjectives}

It is assumed that in Dutch three different forms of {\em wie\/} exist: 
([masc], sing), ([fem], sing) and ([], plur), to produce {\em wiens\/} and two 
times {\em wier\/} respectively. English has only one {\em who\/} and one 
{\em whose\/}.

\subsection{Dem Possessive Adjectives}

It was decided to deal with Dutch {\em diens\/} in analysis only, since translation 
of English {\em his\/} should not give rise to too many ambiguities.
As it is, {\em his\/} will produce {\em zijn, de/het zijne\/} and {\em die/dat 
van hem\/}, 
which seems quite enough to cover the meaning of {\em diens\/} as well. As is 
apparent from the previous, it is assumed that the Dutch DEMPRO {\em die\/} has 
as one of its possible translations the English PERSPRO {\em he\/}. The Dutch 
DemPossAdj rule should then be mapped onto the English PossAdj rule. Since 
English does not need a DemPossAdj rule, this subgrammar is completely missing
in English (cf.\ App.\ B).

\subsection{Determiners}

In Dutch, determiners are generated with -e and -en 
forms, just as adjectives and participles of verbs are. However, since the 
translation of all forms into English seems to be the same, no distinction 
between possible attributive or nominalised use (for which the determiners lack 
an attribute, just as participles of verbs) has been made in the 
rules: {\em beide(n) - both; welk(e) - which\/}. Note that the 
English rule is vacuous: English has no distinction between a BDET and a DET.

At the moment, no rule exists in morphology to form a genitive of determiners. 
However, forms like {\em beider\/} and {\em aller\/} seem to exist as genitives 
of {\em beiden\/} and {\em allen\/} respectively.
Are these forms indeed determiners, derived from a 
nominalisation of {\em beide\/} and {\em alle\/}, or are they separate
indefinite pronouns (which can form genitives)? Should determiners get an 
attribute `possgeni'? 

When a firm decision has been taken as to 
which words belong to the group of determiners,
the local rules will be scanned for problems and deficiencies and 
will be adapted to current needs.

\subsection{Indefinite Pronouns}

Note that for English, the basic IndefPro rule is vacuous, and is only needed 
as counterpart for the Dutch rule. English has only INDEFPROs, while Dutch 
recognises the difference between BIndefPro and IndefPro, since Dutch has an 
inflectional genitive for IndefPros.

It is assumed that all indefinite pronouns that can have a genitive in one
language (all pronouns referring to animate beings?), can also have it in 
the other, except for Dutch {\em men\/}. English 
{\em one's\/} is mapped onto {\em zijn\/} in a separate rule. Since 
{\em one\/} is not only mapped onto {\em men\/}, but also onto {\em je\/}, 
this means that the English IndefProGeni-rule should also be mapped onto the 
Dutch PossAdj-rule to produce the desired {\em je (gen)\/}.

When a full list of indefinite pronouns is available in the test dictionary, 
the rules will be checked for completeness.

\subsection{Wh Pronouns}

In this case, the Dutch rule is a vacuous one, needed only because of the 
difference made in English 
between {\em who (nom, acc)\/} and {\em whom (acc)\/}. Since this is the only 
rule in the subgrammar, the export of Dutch SGWhPro is the same as the head. 
The same holds for the English subgrammars of Determiners and IndefPros.

\subsection{Utterance}
The one rule in this subgrammar deals with the top node UTT.
