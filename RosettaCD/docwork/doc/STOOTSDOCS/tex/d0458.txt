\section{Introduction}
This document discusses the translations of the Dutch  impersonal pronoun {\bf MEN} 
for Spanish. The existing treatment  didn't produce the right translations, 
especially when combinations with clitics appear in a sentence. Considering the 
need to get beter translations, together with the impossibility of dramatically 
changing the existing grammars, I came to the solution outlined in the present 
document. The document  will be centered around the impersonal SEconstruction, 
altough there are other translations as well, which correspond to the other 
two items 'men' that appear in the dictionaries, and which -for the 
completeness of the document-, I will briefly discuss in section 2. In section 
3 I will expose the different impersonal SE constructions in Spanish , with 
special attention to the problems that arise in constructions where the 
impersonal SE appears next to personal CLITIC pronouns. Section 4 will be 
devoted to the implementation of the facts presented in section 2 and 3. Finally, in
section 5 an overview of the yet unsolved problems will be given.\\


For purposes of clearness, let me first explain the terminology I have used:
\begin{itemize}
 \item {\it Impersonal SE Constructions}: correspond with the {\it SEactive 
       sentences} in Rosetta; with those 2 terms, I will refer to those structures
       with an arbitrary (read impersonal indefinite) subject, i.e. de Dutch 
       pronoun MEN or the Spanish clitic SE [+ absorber] (see 3.1.2)
 \item {\it Pronominal Passives}:correspond with the {\it SEpassive sentences} 
       in Rosetta; with those terms I will refer to sentences with a passive 
       meaning and an active form which are translations of the Dutch 
       Impersonal ER sentences.
 \item {\it Impersonal Agentive Constructions}: the Term Agentive has been 
       added to distinguish the impersonal constructions with an intended 
       subject, as {\it se baila/men danst/they dance}, {\it llegan hoy/men komt 
       vandaag aan/they will arrive today}, etc. from the truly impersonal 
       constructions as {\it llueve/het regent/it rains} with no intended 
       subject.
 \item {\it Impersonal SE pronoun}: the SE pronoun that appears in Impersonal 
       SE Constructions. Other instances of SE are not refered to as Impersonal 
       SE.
 \item {\it SE passive clitic}: The instance of SE that appears on pronominal 
       passive sentences, i.e. translations of Dutch ER sentences and the 
       preferred Spanish structure for most passive sentences.\\

\section{Spanish Impersonal Agentive Constructions}
Spanish  impersonal agentive sentences can take different constructions; three  of 
them can be considered as equivalent to the Dutch  impersonal pronoun {\bf MEN}\footnote{There 
are other impersonal agentive constructions where the subject takes the
form of an indefinite NP, like 'la gente'; however, that corresponds with 
other Dutch and English  constructions that also have that kind of NP's
\begin{fnlxam}
&&&La gente ven\'{\i}a andando por la nieve\\
&&&De mensen kwamen door de sneeuw aanlopen\\
&&&People came walking through the snow\\
\end{fnlxam}
This sentences will not be treated here.}\\
The sentence (\ref{1}a) can be translated as (\ref{1}b), (\ref{1}c) or 
(\ref{1}d), depending either on the reading of the pronoun or on 
syntactic and/or semantic features of the sentence.\\
\begin{lxam}
\label{1}
&a&&Men kan later komen\\

&b&&Se puede llegar tarde\\
&c&&Pueden llegar tarde\\
&d&&Uno puede llegar tarde
\end{lxam}
Sometimes it will be semantically and/or syntactically possible to have two 
or even all three structures with only a difference in the interpretation of
the personal pronoun itself. In other cases, only one construction will be 
syntactically and/or semantically possible. However, it is not always easy to 
determine and/or predict in which one(s) of the given structures a given 
impersonal expression will appear  and why it will do so, and, at sentence level, it will be 
often impossible, except for those cases where the choice will depend on 
syntactic incompabilities. The choice becomes easier when semantic and 
pragmatic information is also available. Since we have neither of these yet,
all syntactically possible structures will be generated.\\
At the moment, the three different Spanish  structures are linked to 
the three entries of the Dutch  {\bf MEN} -leaving the scope of the pronoun 
undefinied, explicitly excluding the speaker and explicitly including the 
speaker- which appear in the Rosetta dictionaries; this means that we can use interaction to 
choose which reading of {\bf MEN} we think will be the best for each sentence;
sentence (\ref{1}a) will give the translation on (\ref{1}b) when choosing 
the first entry in interaction; the one on (\ref{1}c) when choosing the second 
entry and the one in (\ref{1}d) when choosing the last entry. When interaction 
is not used, all possible translations will be given.\\
When the semantic and/or pragmatic components are available, the scope of the three 
entries will have to be adjusted to the right syntactic and/or semantic 
restrictions. Also further research will be needed to investigate whether those 
restrictions are cross-linguistic (and present correspondences can hold), or 
whether they are language-specific (and other correspondences need to be 
established).

\subsection{The Impersonal SE construction}
The Spanish  pronoun SE has multiple different uses and translations; this
document only treats these constructions as translations of Dutch  {\bf MEN} 
sentences (and of its equivalent English  sentences).\\
The treatment of the Spanish  SE pronoun throughout the whole Rosetta3 system can be 
found in:
\begin{itemize}
\item Impersonal SE pronoun as translation of Dutch  {\bf MEN} as in
      {\it Se contrata a estudiantes $\rightarrow$ Men neemt studenten aan}
      (in this document and doc. R0398 for earlier version).
\item SE Passive Clitic as translation of Dutch {\bf ER} as in 
      {\it Se venden manzanas $\rightarrow$ ER worden appels verkocht} 
      (see doc. R0398)
\item Other uses of the pronoun SE, as for example in
      {\it Juan se peina} $\rightarrow$ SE Reflexive, or
      {\it Se la regalaron a Pedro} $\rightarrow$ SE as Indirect Object Clitic  
      (see doc. R0398)
\end{itemize}

The Spanish  impersonal SE construction presents a general fact in (a)transitive,
(b)intransitive and (c)attributive constructions\\

\begin{lxam}
\label{2}
&a&&Se venden naranjas\\
&&&Men verkoopt sinaasappels\\
&&&Oranges are sold\\
&b&&Nunca se sabe\\
&&&One never knows\\
&c&&Cuando se es joven...\\
&&&When one is young...
\end{lxam}
Semantically, it can appear in almost every construction, but with some 
classes of verbs -(a)iterative, (b)momentary- the SE construction will result 
in an ill-formed sentence,\\

\begin{lxam}
\label{3}
&a&*&Se llama a la puerta\\
&&&Men klopt aan de deur\\

&b&*&Se llega tarde\\
&&&Men komt laat aan
\end{lxam}
These facts are not yet well explored. In any case, Rosetta still doesn't have
all necessary semantic information to account for the ungrammaticality of 
sentences like (\ref{3}a,b), and research on this matter has been postponed.\\

The impersonal SE construction corresponds to the first reading of {\bf MEN} 
which appears in the dictionary; unlike in the other two constructions, the 
semantic scope of the impersonal subject is not specified, having a much 
stronger impersonal meaning than the others, and two possible interpretations.
The sentence (\ref{4}a) has two readings, either including -as in (\ref{4}b)-,
or excluding- as in (\ref{4}c)- the speaker.\\

\begin{lxam}
\label{4}
&a&&Se venden manzanas\\

&b&&One sells apples\\
&c&&They sell apples
\end{lxam}
An additional problem for the treatment of these sentences comes from the fact 
that reflexive verbs never appear within these constructions\\

\begin{lxam}
\label{5}
&a&&Men haat zichzelf\\
&b&*&Se se odia (a s\'{\i} mismo)
\end{lxam}
In the next section the grammatical aspects of the impersonal SE construction 
will be treated extensively. 

\subsection{The generic ELLOS construction}
The second 'MEN' entry in the dictionary corresponds to the reading that 
necessarily excludes the speaker; the translation of sentences like (\ref{6}a) 
-with the excluding reading- into Spanish , doesn't need any special rules but 
it goes naturally trough the same grammar as the translations of the Dutch  
'generic ZE' (the English  'generic THEY'). The result is a sentence in the 
third person plural, with a generic reading as well, where the personal 
pronoun in subject position has been deleted by means of general subject 
deletion transformations, like in (\ref{6}b).\\

\begin{lxam}
\label{6}
&a&&Men verkoopt daar sinaasappels\\
&&&They sell oranges there\\
 
&b&&All\'{\i} venden naranjas
\end{lxam}  

The generic ELLOS construction is used to present a singular fact that has been 
particularized\footnote{that is, when the subject, altough it remains undefinied,
has an specific rather than a generic referent.} as in (\ref{7}a,b). With this 
reading, it is not possible to have an impersonal construction with
SE, as we have seen in sentences (\ref{3}a,b)\footnote{Notice that sentences 
under (\ref{3}a,b) will be correct if understood as having an  habitual reading,
as we see in the sentences hier below; in fact, a correlation could be 
established between generic subject and habitual aspect, and between specific 
subject and accidental (meant as the counterpart of habitual) aspect.
\begin{fnlxam}
&&&Se llama {\em siempre} a la puerta\\
&&&Men klopt {\em altijd} aan de deur\\

&&&Se llega {\em siempre} tarde\\
&&&Men komt {\em altijd} laat aan\\
\end{fnlxam}
}

\begin{lxam}
\label{7}
&a&&Llaman a la puerta\\
&&&Men klopt aan de deur\\

&b&&Llegan tarde\\
&&&Men komt laat an\\
\end{lxam}

or in sentences where the impersonal subject represents an allready known 
collective subject, as in (\ref{8}a,b)\\

\begin{lxam}
\label{8}
&a&&En los pueblos alojan gratis a los visitantes\\
&&&In het platteland, geeft men gratis onderdak aan de bezoekers\\

&b&&Dicen que los fantasmas rondan el castillo\\
&&&Men zegt dat de spoken door het kasteel wandelen
\end{lxam}

The sentences in (\ref{7}a,b) are exactly those sentences that do not accept an 
impersonal SE construction, as is shown in (\ref{3}a,b); on the contrary, the 
sentences on (\ref{8}a,b) do present an impersonal SE construction, as is shown 
in (\ref{9}a,b), the only difference in the interpretation of both 
constructions being the explicit exclusion of the speaker on the scope of the 
impersonal subject in (\ref{8}a,b), while in (\ref{9}a,b) neither the 
exclusion or the inclusion of the speaker in this scope is explicit\\

\begin{lxam}
\label{9}
&a&&En los pueblos se aloja gratis a los visitantes\\
&&&In het platteland, geeft men gratis onderdak aan de bezoekers\\

&b&&Se dice que los fantasmas rondan el castillo\\
&&&Men zegt dat de spoken door het kasteel wandelen
\end{lxam}

The 'generic ELLOS' construction will also be used in sentences with reflexive 
verbs, since there the impersonal SE construction is not possible.  This use of 
the 'generic ELLOS' construction will be outlined in the next section.\\

The 'generic ELLOS' construction will then be used in case of:\\

\begin{itemize}
  \item Collective subject:    Dicen que los fantasmas rondan el castillo
  \item Particularized facts:  Llaman a la puerta
  \item Reflexive Verbs:       Se afeitan (Men scheert zich)
\end{itemize}


\subsection{The UNO construction}
The third {\bf MEN} entry in the dictionary corresponds to the reading that 
necessarily includes the speaker; the translation of sentences as (\ref{10}a) 
with the reading which includes the speaker, doesn't need any special rules but
it goes naturally trough the same grammar as the translations of the Dutch  
'generic JE' (or the English ONE). The result is a sentence in the third 
person singular, where the indefinite pronoun UNO appears as impersonal subject
, as in (\ref{10}b).\\
 
\begin{lxam}
\label{10}
&a&&Men zou het beter moeten weten\\
&&& One should know better\\

&b&&Uno ya deber\'{\i}a saberlo
\end{lxam}

The use of UNO constructions is general whenever modals (\ref{11}a) and 
negation (\ref{11}b) appear in a sentence\\

\begin{lxam}
\label{11}
&a&&Uno siempre puede contar con ellos\\
&&& One can always count on them\\
&&& Men kan altijd op hen rekenen\\

&b&&Uno nunca sabe\\
&&& One never knows\\
&&& Men weet het maar nooit     
\end{lxam}

but will at best give strange sentences when used with positive 
sentences or in sentences without modal verbs.\\

Generally, the semantics in these sentences force the interpretation which 
includes the speaker in the impersonal subject; however, if such an interpretation 
must be avoided, the grammar will choose the equivalent 'SE construction', as 
in (\ref{12}a,b)\\

\begin{lxam}
\label{12}
&a&&Siempre se puede contar con ellos\\
&b&&Nunca se sabe
\end{lxam}
 
In causative constructions, however, the use of the UNO construction will be 
avoided\footnote{Notice that in English, ONE will also be avoided, being 
replaced by passive constructions}, and the grammar will prefer the corresponding
SE construction (\ref{13}a),except for those cases in which the impersonal 
subject has been emphazised (\ref{13}b)\\

\begin{lxam}
\label{13}
&a&&Se hizo desalojar las casas\\      
&b&& UNO hizo desalojar las casas\\
&&& * Men liet de huizen verlaten
\end{lxam}
I do not have any explanation for these facts yet.\\

The 'UNO' construction will also be used in sentences with reflexive verbs, 
since the impersonal SE construction is not possible there. This use of 
the 'UNO' construction will be outlined in the next section.\\

The UNO construction will then be used in case of:\\

\begin{itemize}
  \item Modal Verbs : Uno siempre puede contar con ellos
  \item Negation    : Uno nunca sabe  
  \item Reflexives  : Uno se afeita siempre a marchas forzadas
\end{itemize}


\section{The Impersonal SE Construction}
The impersonal SE construction derives from an earlier construction with the 
true impersonal subject {\it HOMBRE}; these earlier constructions, like the 
true impersonal {\bf SE} sentences, always had the verb in third person singular, 
since it had to agree with the subject, which was morphologically singular; 
one can find examples in the literature until the sixteenth century.\\

\begin{lxam}
\label{14}
&&&Andando a oscuras, presto tropieza hombre\\
&&&Walking in the dark, people easily fall
\end{lxam}
However, the use of {\it HOMBRE} as impersonal pronoun has totally disappeared in 
modern Spanish , where we find the {\bf SE} construction -among others- to indicate 
an impersonal subject. The actual version of (\ref{14}) will be then the 
sentence in (\ref{15})\\

\begin{lxam}
\label{15}
&&&Andando a oscuras, se tropieza con facilidad\\
&&&Lopend in het donker, men kan makkelijk vallen
\end{lxam}

\subsection{The syntactic status of the impersonal SE pronoun}
In the Rosetta translation system, impersonal SE is treated just as another 
instance of the reflexive clitic. In a transformation, the subject position 
created by the Dutch pronoun {\bf MEN} is deleted, and {\bf SE} (the reflexive 
SE, since it is the only existing one) is inserted under the clitic node; the 
result is that, once SE has been inserted\footnote{which does not happen in the 
same transformation for both sentences}, the translations of impersonal {\bf MEN} 
sentences (\ref{16}) and reflexive sentences (\ref{17}) take the same structure\\  

\begin{lxam}
\label{16}
&&&Men danst\\
&&&Se$_{[+refl]}$ baila
\end{lxam}

\begin{lxam}
\label{17}
&&&Hij wast zich\\
&&&Se$_{[+refl]}$ lava
\end{lxam}
Computationally speaking, arguments of efficiency support this choice: the 
existence of more than one {\bf SE} entry in the dictionaries would create  
unnecessary lexical ambig\"{u}ities or could even lead to combinatorial 
explosions when parsing any Spanish construction with a {\bf SE} pronoun in 
it.\footnote{Whether this was indeed the best solution -even from a computational 
point of view- cannot be decided without further investigation into its 
consequences in interaction with {\it all} relevant aspects of the grammar, 
which is far beyond the goals of these document}\\
Theoretically speaking, however, although the syntactic status of impersonal 
{\bf SE} still is controversial, there are reasons to assume that both {\bf SE} pronouns do not have 
anything else in common than their morphological form, that is, that they are in 
fact two different and independent syntactic and semantic elements; this 
assumptions seems to be supported by a great number of language experts from both 
the traditional grammar (like M. Moliner; see references) as well as from 
generative linguistics (for example, C. Otero; see references).\\


\subsubsection{Impersonal SE in the Traditional Grammar}
Traditionally, the Real Academia has considered the impersonal SE pronoun as a 
'sign of impersonality' -adjunct to the verb- in the same way as the SE that 
appears in pronominal passives is considered a 'sign of passivity'. But the 
syntactic function of SE in both constructions is different.\\
In pronominal passives, the grammatical Subject -the verb agrees with it in 
person and number -, is the semantic Object ({\it los pl\'{a}tanos} in  
\ref{18}a), and SE keeps its reflexive value as grammatical Object coindexed with the 
grammatical Subject; the sentence is passive, since there is no difference in 
the interpretetion of (\ref{18}a) and (\ref{18}b)\\
   
\begin{lxam}
\label{18}
&a&&Los pl\'{a}tanos se cultivan en pa\'{\i}ses tropicales\\
&b&&Los pl\'{a}tanos son cultivados en pa\'{\i}ses tropicales
\end{lxam}
But in impersonal sentences such as (\ref{19}a), the grammatical Direct Object 
is obviously not SE, but the semantic Object of the verb, as can be proved by
(\ref{19}b), the passive counterpart of the same sentence.\\

\begin{lxam}
\label{19}
&a&&Se avisa a los interesados\\
&b&&Los interesados son avisados
\end{lxam} 
In (\ref{19}a), SE cannot bear the same index as the Direct Object, losing 
its reflexive character. Altough the Real Academia denies such an analysis, some 
grammarians (as M. Moliner among others) consider the impersonal SE as the 
grammatical subject of the sentence; they support this hypothesis with several 
arguments:\\

\begin{itemize}
  \item Intuitively, impersonal SE sentences do have an active subject, which 
        could only be represented by SE
  \item In the impersonal SE constructions, SE cannot be just a 
        modifier \footnote{hier this term is not supposed to have the same 
        structural meaning it is given inside GB theory} of the verb, -as in 
        passives, where SE accounts for a passive reading of the 
        action-, since the verb has its genuine active value
   \item The impersonal SE construction can appear in atributive sentences, 
         -although the Real Academia rejects them- like {\it Cuando se es joven} or 
        {\it Se puede ser pobre y feliz}; The well formedness of such 
        constructions requires a subject for the attribute(s) to refer to.
\end{itemize}
Altough these arguments will be very easy to refute from a teoretical point of
vieuw, the actual relevance of this approach relies on the fact that it makes
a difference between pronominal passives (se passive in Rosetta) and impersonal
constructions (se active in Rosetta)-including the ones morphologically 
identical to the SE-passive construction \footnote{see below} (se active-like in
Rosetta)- has been made, a difference that has been crucial in deciding the 
(partially) new approach of impersonal SE constructions in Rosetta.\\

\subsubsection{Impersonal SE in GB theory}
In early works, some generativists did consider impersonal SE a subject as 
well; in analyzing the Italian Si-constructions, Chomsky 
assumed that both active and passive SI\footnote{or SE for spanish} 
construction have the same D-structure, (\ref{20}a).  SI/SE may either  
absorb Objective Case\footnote{exactly in the same way passive morphology 
absorbs Objective Case in real passive constructions}, yielding the pronominal
passive sentence in (\ref{20}b), or be assigned Nominative case, yielding the 
active sentence in (\ref{20}c); since PRO -the EC in subject position- cannot 
absorb the subject thetarol -being in a null position-, it will be assigned to 
SI\\

\begin{lxam}
\label{20}
&a&&[$_{np}${\it e}] si mangia [$_{np}$ le mele]\\

&b&&Le mele si mangiano\\
&b'&&Las manzanas se comen\\
&&&Apples are eaten\\  
&&&Le mele [$_{infl}$ Tense, AGR, si][$_{vp}$ mangi- t]\\

&c&&Si mangia le mele\\
&c'&&Se come(n) manzanas\\ 
&&&People eat apples\\
&&&PRO [$_{vp}$ si-mangia le mele]\\
\end{lxam}

Otero\footnote{in Otero(1986)}, however, rejects the assumption that the clitic
itself is the subject of (\ref{20}c'); he assumes, based on the fact that
Spanish has obligatory onderlying EC subjects -pro, as in (\ref{21}a)- that impersonal SE 
constructions also have EC subjects at D-structure, which are interpreted as 
ARB\footnote{Arbitrary PRO}, as in (\ref{21}b).\\

\begin{lxam}
\label{21}
&a&&pro (SE) va a la playa\\
&&&He/She goes to the beach\\
&b&&ARB SE va a la playa\\
&&&People go to the beach
\end{lxam}

In this analisys, in (\ref{21}b), SE acts as an {\it Absorber clitic}, 
which absorbs the definiteness of a finite INFL; in this view, SE is a 
surface manifestation of part of the content of INFL'\footnote{Otero, 1986}, 
which alters its content, turning a [+DEF] INFL partially into a [-DEF] INFL 
-which still includes Tense and Agreement-, and forcing the ARB interpretation of
the EC subject, as in (\ref{22}b); if the {\it Absorber clitic} is not a part 
of INFL, the EC subject is not interpreted as ARB, but as a subject pronoun 
which remains {\it phonetically unrealized}, as in (\ref{22}a)\\

\begin{lxam}
\label{22}
&a&&pro,[$_{infl}$ ..[+DEF]..   ],[$_{vp}$ va a la playa]\\
&b&&ARB,[$_{infl}$ ..[-DEF]..,SE],[$_{vp}$ va a la playa]
\end{lxam}

Under this analysis, the impersonal SE is a non-referring clitic attached 
to the verb in surface structure, which is also the way SE is treated in the 
Rosetta system.\\

However, there are also sentences where the functional rol of {\bf SE} seems to 
be that of {\it Identifier clitic} instead of an absorber; in these cases, 
{\bf SE} is always related to the object\footnote{since in Spanish, object 
clitics are the only {\it Identifier Clitics}}, as we see in (\ref{23})\\
 
\begin{lxam}
\label{23}
&a&&se$_{i}$ afeita e$_{i}$\\
&&&He/she shaves himself/herself\\

&b&&pro se$_{i}$ lava las manos e$_{i}$\\
&&&she/he washes her/his hands  
\end{lxam}

It seems then that there are two instances of SE - that in (\ref{21}b) and that 
in (\ref{23}), which  are basically different, since they do not only play a
different functional role -that of Absorber and that of Identifier respectively
- but they also show a different syntactic behaviour.\footnote{as we can see, 
for instance, in the contrast between the next two sentences (found in Otero, 1986)
\begin{fnlxam}
&&&pro se admira a s\'{\i} misma\\
&&&She admires herself\\

&&*&ARB se admira a s\'{\i} misma\\
&&&One admires oneself
\end{fnlxam}}
In this section, an argument for the existence of, at least two different 
SE morphemes -the Absorber one and the Identifier one- in the grammar has been 
given.\footnote{In the Rosetta grammars, this difference is expressed by means 
of a different analysis -as PRONP the {\it Absorber clitic} and as REFL the
{\it Identifier clitic}- of both instances of SE, which holds all along the 
grammar, until the ClausetoSentence Subgrammar, where both take the same 
position under the clitic node in the SeSpelling Transformations; from this 
moment, it becomes impossible to recognize the original nature of the clitic, 
and further research will be needed in order to determine whether it would be 
desirable -despite the computational objections- to morphologycally 
differentiate between both instances of SE; such a distinction could be 
specially desirable for the Surface Parser.}Such an approach would not only 
be based on theoretical principles, but will also correspond to the native 
intuitions about the nature of the several instances of SE.

\subsection{The syntax of impersonal SE constructions}
The impersonal SE construction, as already said above, occurs with the verb in
third person singular, in intransitive (\ref{24}a) as well as in transitive 
(\ref{24}b,c) sentences\\

\begin{lxam}
\label{24}
&a&&Se baila\\
&&& Men danst\\

&b&&Se contrata a los estudiantes\\
&&& Men neemt the studenten aan\\
&c&&Se intenta llegar a un acuerdo\\
&&& Men probeert tot een akkoord te komen\\
\end{lxam}


\subsubsection{Constructions with Verb-Object Agreement}
In modern Spanish , when the verb has a canonical Direct Object -realised as an NP-, the
verb will show agreement with it\footnote{See also doc 398 for further details},
if\\
\begin{itemize}
  \item The object is a [- animate] NP, as in (\ref{25})
  \item The object is a [+ animate] and [-specific], as in (\ref{26})
\end{itemize}
The sentences with a {\bf [- animate] NP} in Object position  will always show 
agreement between the verb and the object\\

\begin{lxam}
\label{25}
&a&&Se compran manzanas\\
&&& Men koopt appels\\
&b&*&Se compra manzanas
\end{lxam}
Sentences with a {\bf [+ animate] NP} in Object position will show agreement between 
the verb and its object if the NP is also {\bf [- specific]}\footnote{as we will see
later on, the pych verbs do present different linguistic facts} and therefore,
it does not get the accusative 'A' of animate Direct Objects.
The sentences in (\ref{25}b) and (\ref{26}b), without agreement, are 
ungrammatical, altough sentence (\ref{25}b) is considered correct by some native 
speakers (especially in Latin-America).\\

\begin{lxam}
\label{26}
&a&&Se contratan estudiantes\\
&b&*&Se contrata estudiantes\\
&&& Men neemt studenten aan
\end{lxam}

The sentences in (\ref{25}a) and (\ref{26}a) present the same syntactic form as the 
pronominal passive constructions\footnote{recall that pronominal passive 
constructions, SEpassive in Rosetta, always show agreement between the verb and 
its object, as in {\it Se cultivan pl\'{a}tanos}}, and in a short sentence it 
will be impossible to make a semantic differentiation between the impersonal SE 
constructions\footnote{SEactive in Rosetta} and the pronominal passive; the 
sentence in (\ref{27}a) will then have two interpretations, those in 
(\ref{27}b,c)\\

\begin{lxam}
\label{27}
&a&&Se contratan estudiantes\\
&b&&Son contratados estudiantes\\
&&&Er worden studenten aangenomen\\
&c&&Alguien contrata estudiantes\\
&&&Men neemt studenten aan
\end{lxam}
However, when sentences are placed into a context, syntactic, semantic and/or 
pragmatic) considerations can help to disambiguate the sentence, as we can see
if we look at the interpretation of sentences (\ref{28}a) and (\ref{29}a)\\   

\begin{lxam}
\label{28}
&a&&Los pl\'{a}tanos se cultivan en los pa\'{\i}ses tropicales\\
&b&&Los pl\'{a}tanos son cultivados en los pa\'{\i}ses tropicales\\
&&&Bananen worden in de tropische landen verbouwd\\ 
&&& Bananas are cultivated in the tropical countries
\end{lxam}

\begin{lxam}
\label{29}
&a&&En los pa\'{\i}ses tropicales se cultivan pl\'{a}tanos\\
&&&In de tropische landen verbouwt men bananen\\
&&& In the tropical countries, people cultivate bananas\\
&b&&En los pa\'{\i}ses tropicales son cultivados pl\'{a}tanos\footnotemark\\
&&&In de tropische landen worden bananen verbouwd
\end{lxam} 
\footnotetext{this  
sentence, if grammatical at all, would only appear in certain special contexts, 
where extra machinery will have to apply to license the object of a passive 
verb to stay in its underliyng position. However, even if grammatical, it does 
not preserve the meaning of the SE construction in (\ref{29}a).}

Syntactically, in the sentences in (\ref{28}), the underlying object 'los pl\'{a}tanos' 
appears in the surface position of the passive subject in order to get the case
it can't get from the passive verb; (\ref{28}a) can be substituted by 
(\ref{28}b) without a difference in meaning being involved\footnote{notice that 
both sentences (\ref{28}a and b) have the same translations}. But that is 
not the case in (\ref{29}a), since the passive counterpart in (\ref{29}b) has
not the same meaning\footnote{notice that, in this case, the meaning of the 
passive counterpart actually corresponds with the passive pharaphrase of (\ref{28}a)}
. This semantic difference, toghether with the syntactic structure of (\ref{29}a), 
where the underlying object remains in object position and gets case from the 
verb, seem to tell us that in this case this,we are not in front of a 
{\it Pronominal Passive construction}.
Syntactic and semantic differences outlined above become clear when one takes 
pragmatic features of (\ref{28}a) and (\ref{29}a) into account. Whereas in 
(\ref{28}a) the TOPIC of the sentence rests on the underlying object, in 
(\ref{29}a) the TOPIC rests on the locative prepositional phrase.\\ 
There where other languages -as, for instance Dutch- express two different 
basic meanings by using two different syntactic structures (in Dutch  MEN and ER 
sentences), Spanish seem to use rather pragmatics to differentiate between the 
different interpretations of two in the surface identical (part of) structures.
 
\subsubsection{Reflexive Constructions}
As was said above, a problem arises whenever the verb is reflexive; the 
Spanish  grammar does not allow 2 sequences of the pronoun SE in the same 
sentence and that prevents us for translating sentences like (\ref{30}a) by 
means of the impersonal SE construction, since the result would be the ill-
formed sentence in (\ref{30}b), where the first SE corresponds to the 
impersonal subject and the second SE is the reflexive pronoun. To translate 
these sentences it will be necessary to disambiguate the semantic scope of the 
impersonal subject, which will give us the two different translations, those 
under (\ref{30}c) and (\ref{30}d)\\

\begin{lxam}
\label{30}
&a&&Men haat zichzelf\\
&b&*&Se se odia (a s\'{\i} mismo)\\

&c&&Uno se odia (a s\'{\i} mismo)\\
&d&&Se odian (a s\'{\i} mismos)
\end{lxam}

In (\ref{30}c) the impersonal SE has been substituted by the indefinite UNO 
to avoid the double SE sequence; yet the impersonal subject necessarily includes
the speaker and so it has just one reading.\\
In (\ref{30}d) the impersonal SE has been substituted by the generic ELLOS to 
avoid the double SE sequence; the impersonal subject necessarily excludes  the 
speaker, having just one reading as well.\\
It is interesting to notice that English  will give exactly the same 
translations for the Dutch  sentence in (\ref{30}a)\\

\begin{lxam}
\label{31}
&c&&One hates oneself\\
&d&&They hate themselves
\end{lxam}

\subsection{Constructions with Clitics}
In sentences where the impersonal SE interacts with other personal clitic 
pronouns in object position, additional problems arise; the behaviour of these
sentences will depend on the value of the [animate] feature of the pronoun; the
sentences can be grouped into two behaviour-groups:\\
\begin{itemize}
  \item Sentences with [+ animate] pronouns, that will appear in constructions 
        without agreement.
  \item Sentences with [- animate] pronouns, that will appear in construction 
        with agreement\footnote{In Rosetta, pronouns which can have both antecedents
   either [+animate] or [-animate] -as we will see below, in impersonal SE 
   constructions only {\bf LA/LAS} features that-, will appear in both 
   constructions, since the system has yet no means to connect a pronoun with
   its antecedent.}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Animate Personal Clitic Pronouns}
Pronouns in the first or second person will always have [+ animate] antecedents
; therefore, they will always appear in impersonal SE constructions with the 
verb in the singular, despite the number of the object\\

\begin{lxam}
\label{32}
&a&&Se me recomienda\\
&&&Men beveelt mij aan\\

&b&&Se os recomienda\\
&&&Men beveelt jullie aan\\
\end{lxam}

Pronouns of the third person with a [+ animate] antecedent will, of course, 
appear in the same kind of sentence\\

\begin{lxam}
\label{33}
&a&&Se le/la/*lo recomienda\\     
&&&Men beveelt hem/haar\footnotemark
aan\\

&b&&Se les/las/*los recomienda\\
&&&Men beveelt hun\footnotemark
aan
\end{lxam}
\addtocounter{footnote}{-1}\footnotetext{hem/haar is understood as having an 
[+animate] antecedent}\addtocounter{footnote}{1}
\footnotetext{hun is understood as having an [+animate] antecedent}
The use of the accusative pronouns {\bf LO/LOS} in impersonal sentences seems to be 
blocked. In personal sentences, the use of the Dative clitic {\bf LE/LES} as a 
Direct Object clitic with [+ animate] antecedent is optional (altough preferred 
by many speakers), but in impersonal sentences it is the only option; the 
ungrammaticality of {\bf LO/LOS} in impersonal SE constructions is probably 
meant to indicate that only [+animate] clitics can appear there\footnote{See below}. On 
the other hand, {\bf LA/LAS} is not blocked, since it doesn't have the possibility
of being substituted by another pronoun.


\subsubsection{No-Animate Personal Clitic Pronouns}
Spanish  accusative clitics of the third person can also have a [- animate] 
antecedent -except for LE/LES-. As we have already seen above, when the object 
is [- animate], impersonal SE constructions show agreement between verb and 
object (the SEpassive-like sentences). So, if the object is a pronoun that has 
been clitiziced to preverbal position, impersonal SE constructions will show 
agreement between the verb and the clitic.\\

\begin{lxam}
\label{34}
&a&&Se lo recomienda\\
&b&&Se las recomiendan
\end{lxam}
Yet, the SE pronoun in sentences in (\ref{34}a,b) can only be understood as 
being the surface form of an Indirect Object and their only possible reading is 
the one in (\ref{35}a,b)\\

\begin{lxam}
\label{35}
&a&&Se lo recomienda\\
&&&(hij)beveelt hem/haar het aan\\
&b&&Se las recomiendan\\
&&&(hij)beveelt hun ze aan
\end{lxam}
But when SE is interpreted as impersonal pronoun, the sentences in 
(\ref{34}a,b) are ungrammatical, and language will have to find another way to
express the reading in (\ref{36}a,b)\\

\begin{lxam}
\label{36}
&a&*&Se lo recomienda\\
&&&Men beveelt het aan\\
&b&*&Se las recomiendan\\
&&&Men beveelt ze \footnotemark
aan
\end{lxam}
\footnotetext{hun is understood as having a [+animate] antecedent} 
In fact, the Object clitic disappears from the surface of the sentence. Through
Clitic Doubling, the clitic moves to a preverbal position; because these 
sentences do have agreement between the verb and the object clitic, surface 
rules take it to be a grammatical subject and delete it, just at they do 
with any other subject pronoun in Spanish . The Spanish  sentences with the 
readings in (\ref{36}a,b) will be\\

\begin{lxam}
\label{37}
&a&&Se recomienda\\
&b&&Se recomiendan
\end{lxam}
The deleted pronoun can only be of the third person, since it is the only one 
with a possible [- animate] antecedent, and the number is reflected on the verb; 
however, this construction does lose the gender of the pronoun.


\subsubsection{Contructions with Two Object Clitics}
When an impersonal SE construction appears with both Direct Object and Indirect
Object in pronominal form, the Direct Object pronoun will be able to cliticize 
and appear on the surface only if\\

\begin{itemize}
  \item Direct Object is a first person pronoun\footnote{although some 
grammarians (Y. and C. Sol\'{e} among others) consider the coexistence of two 
clitic objects in impersonal SE constructions always impossible, (\ref{100}) 
is often used by natives}, as in (\ref{100})\\

        \begin{lxam}
        \label{100}
         &&&Se te me/nos recomienda\\
         &&&Men beveelt jou mij/ons aan
        \end{lxam} 

  \item Due to general clitic order rules, the Indirect Object pronoun remains
        in postverbal position, leaving the Direct Object free to cliticize, as
        in (\ref{38}a,b)\\

        \begin{lxam}
        \label{38}
         &a&&Se me recomienda a t\'{\i}\\
         &&&Men beveelt mij jou aan\\
         &b&&Se te recomienda a ella\\
         &&&Men beveelt haar jou aan  
        \end{lxam}
\end{itemize}
If other clitic combinations hold , the Direct Object pronoun will not 
appear in the surface sentence. This will follow quite naturally if the Direct
Object pronoun has a [- animate] antecedent, in which case it will be deleted 
as we have already seen\\

\begin{lxam}
\label{39}
&a&*&Se me lo recomienda\\
&b&&Se me recomienda\\
&&&Men beveelt het me aan\\

&c&*&Se lo recomienda\\
&&&Men beveelt het aan       
\end{lxam} 
But if the Direct Object pronoun has a [+ animate] antecedent, a contrast will 
appear between sentences with one and with two object pronouns\\

\begin{lxam}
\label{40}
&a&*&Se me le/la recomienda\\
&b&&Se me recomienda\\
&&&Men beveelt mij hem/haar aan\\

&c&&Se le/la recomienda\\
&&&Men beveelt hem/haar aan 
\end{lxam} 
which will pose a problem if we try to explain this phenomenon with 
theoretical principles.
 
Sentences (\ref{39}b) and (\ref{40}b) are the only possibility to translate the 
Dutch  sentences in (\ref{39})-(\ref{40}) in a Spanish  impersonal SE 
construction. However, in order to avoid ambiguity in the interpretation of 
the deleted pronoun, Spanish  will prefer the alternative impersonal 
construction with 'generic ELLOS'\footnote{in Rosetta, this last possibility 
has not been implemented yet}\\

\begin{lxam}
\label{41}
&a&&Me lo recomiendan (\ref{39}b)\\
&b&&Me le(lo)/la recomiendan (\ref{40}b)
\end{lxam}

\section{The Implementation}
In the previous sections, an overview of the linguistic facts one must account for 
has been given; in the present section, I will present some aspects of the 
actual implementation, in so far as changes have been introduced with respect to 
previous solutions.

\subsection{The Chosen Approach}
The actual aproach to Spanish  SE constructions has been extensively outlined in a 
previous document (doc 398); also the theoretical grounds for choosing this 
approach, as well as the remaining problems that couldn't be solved with it,
can be found there. In the present document, only the implementation of 
{\it Impersonal SE constructions} as the Spanish counterparts of Dutch 
sentences with the indefinite MEN will be briefly outlined.\\

In short, the INDEFPRO that accounts for the basic expression {\bf MEN} is 
substituted by impersonal SE in the ClauseToSentence subgrammar by means of 
transformations. In an earlier version, these transformations took place after 
the clitic rules, almost at the end of the subgrammar, where also SE-passive 
transformations where carried out, making it impossible for the grammar 
to account for the linguistic facts exposed above when personal clitics 
appeared. In the last version, {\it Pronominal Passives} or 
{\it SEpassive constructions} and {\it Impersonal SE constructions} or 
{\it SEactive sentences}, including the {\bf SEpassive-like constructions} (the 
ones with agreement), are treated in a different way, the implementation of 
both being totally independent from each other.\\

Since the behaviour of clitics in impersonal SE constructions is different from 
their behaviour in other sentences, it seems reasonable to think that the 
insertion of the impersonal SE takes place before Clitic Doubling applies, for 
the grammar to be able to block sentences as (\ref{34}a), (\ref{39}a) and 
(\ref{40}a).\\

Therefore, in the present version, the transformations for impersonal SE in 
active sentences -translations of Dutch  MEN sentences-, have been separated 
from the pronominal Passive -translations of Dutch  passive impersonal sentences
-; the latter group of SEspelling rules remained at the end of the subgrammar, 
after the Mood rules, whereas the first group of SEspelling rules has been 
moved to the beginning of the subgrammar, right after the substitution rules and 
before the Clitic Rules apply.\\

In this way, and after modifying the Clitic Transformations, Rosetta can 
account for the linguistic facts outlined in previous sections in a natural way
by means of the interaction of the SEspelling Transformations with the General 
Clitic Transformations, without having to add extra machinery to block ill-
formed impersonal SE expressions. 

\subsection{The Transformations}
The impersonal SE active constructions in Rosetta are formed by means of several 
transformations and their corresponding filters, that make sure transformations 
are applied whenever this is possible.\\

In the earlier version, Dutch  {\bf MEN} constructions were always translated into 
impersonal SE constructions without agreement between verb and object\footnote{
altough it was planned to eliminate this restriction, the actual changes were 
never fully implemented, and the restriction remained}(also called SE ACTIVE 
constructions); impersonal SE constructions with agreement 
between verb and object were only seen as the Spanish  counterpart of the Dutch 
impersonal passive with {\bf WORDEN}. The following translations were given:\\

\begin{lxam}
\label{42}
&a&&Er worden appels verkocht\\
&a'&&Se venden manzanas\\
&b&&Men verkoopt appels\\
&b'&&Se vende manzanas
\end{lxam}
But the sentence given in (\ref{42}b') is considered -at least by many 
natives- to be ungrammatical, as seen earlier in (\ref{25}b). In fact, 
translation of both Dutch sentences (\ref{42} a and b) will have the same 
surface form, namely sentence (\ref{42}a'). The other way around, when 
translating from Spanish into Dutch, (\ref{42}a') -which has two 
interpretations- will have two translations, namely those in  
(\ref{42}a) and (\ref{42}b).\\

As outlined above -in examples (\ref{28}) and (\ref{29})-, there seems to be a 
difference in the interpretation of impersonal SE constructions with agreement 
between verb and object and pronominal passive sentences. Furthermore, unlike 
Dutch, Spanish  impersonal passive\footnote{with agreement} and active\footnote{without agreement}
sentences are morphollogically identical, and there is no reason to think that
it should not be interpreted as both. Therefore, a sentence as (\ref{42}) can 
have both interpretations, {\it Men verkoopt appels} and {\it ER worden appels
verkocht}.\\

There are three basic SEspelling transformations:\\
\begin{itemize}
  \item {\bf TSEspelling}
  \item {\bf TSEspellingPassive}
  \item {\bf TSEspellingCLpassive}
\end{itemize}
and two alternative transformations to take care of constructions with 
reflexive verbs:\\
\begin{itemize}
  \item {\bf TUNOspelling}
  \item {\bf TEmptySEspelling}
\end{itemize}
each one having a correspondent filter.


\subsubsection{TSEspelling}
TSEspelling applies into\\

                          
\begin{itemize}
\item {\bf Intransitive sentences}
 
           \begin{lxam}
           \label{43}
           &&&Men danst $\rightarrow$ Se baila 
           \end{lxam}       
                        
\item {\bf Transitive sentences}
   \begin{enumerate}
       \item With {\bf no NP as Direct Object}\\
     
                   \begin{lxam}
                   \label{44}
                   &&&Men zegt dat hij sterk is $\rightarrow$ Se dice que es fuerte\\
                   &&&Men spreekt hun aan $\rightarrow$ Se habla con ellos
                   \end{lxam}        
      \item With a {\bf [+ animate], [+ specific] full NP or a 
                    [+ animate] Pronoun as Direct Object}:\\
                                         
                     \begin{lxam}
                     \label{45}
                     &&&Men neemt studenten aan $\rightarrow$ Se contrata a estudiantes\\
                     &&&Men neemt hun aan    $\rightarrow$  Se les contrata
                     \end{lxam}                    
      \end{enumerate}
\end{itemize}
and substitutes the empty INDEFPRO with the impersonal SE (that appears as a 
reflexive), leaving the verb in the third person singular. In the case of a 
pronominal NP object, interaction later on with the general Clitic Rules will 
yield the correct sentences. 

\subsubsection{SEspellingPassive}
TSEspellingPassive applies to {\it Transitive Sentences} with a {\it full NP}
as Direct Object, that can be either
\begin{itemize}
\item {\bf [- animate]}
                \begin{lxam}
                \label{46}
                &&&Men verkoopt sinaasappels $\rightarrow$ Se venden naranjas
                \end{lxam}           
                          
\item {\bf [+ animate] and [- specific]}\\
               \begin{lxam}
               \label{47}
               &&&Men neemt studenten aan $\rightarrow$ Se contratan estudiantes   
               \end{lxam}                 
                          
\end{itemize}
substituting the empty INDEFPRO with the impersonal SE and giving the verb the
number of its object.

\subsubsection{SEspellingCLpassive}
TSEspellingCLpassive applies to {\it Transitive Sentences} with a {\it 
[- animate] pronominal NP}\\

\begin{lxam}
\label{48}
&&&Men verkoopt het $\rightarrow$ Se compra
\end{lxam}
This transformation gives the clitic Object the status of a Subject, placing it
into a preverbal position (a full NP has to stay in Object position) and 
changing its case into Nominative; later on it will be deleted by deletion rules later
on the grammar. It also gives the verb the number of the clitic. Once again, 
interaction later on with the general Clitic Rules will give the correct sentence. 
          
\subsubsection{TUNOspelling}
This transformation applies when the verb of the impersonal sentence is 
reflexive; since a impersonal SE construction will be impossible, an 
alternative transformation is necessary to avoid a system crash. This 
construction includes the speaker in the semantic scope of the impersonal 
subject\\

\begin{lxam}
\label{49}
&&&Vaak herinnert men zich zijn jeugd\\
&&&Uno se acuerda a menudo de su infancia\\

&&&One often remembers one's childhood  
\end{lxam}
Unlike other instances of sentences with UNO as impersonal subject -outlined in
the section dedicated to the \underline{UNO construction}-, the input for this 
transformation will be the same one as for the SEspelling transformations in 
the case of no-reflexive sentences. TUNOspelling substitutes the INDEFPRO in 
the input pattern by the UNO pronoun, in the same way SEspelling transformations 
substitute it by impersonal SE. 

\subsubsection{TEmptySEspelling}
If the verb is reflexive, but one does not wish to include oneself in the scope of 
the impersonal subject, another alternative transformation will be needed. 
TEmptySEspelling will apply to sentences with reflexive verbs, automatically 
excluding the speaker from the scope of the impersonal subject\\

\begin{lxam}
\label{50}
&&&Vaak herinnert men zich zijn jeugd\\
&&&Se acuerdan de su infancia\\

&&&They often remember their childhood  
\end{lxam}
The input of this transformation will be the same one as for the SEspelling 
transformations as well, differing also from other instances of sentences with
the \underline{generic ELLOS} construction, -see section 2.2-. TEmptySEspelling 
substitutes the INDEFPRO in the input pattern by generic ELLOS, which will be 
deleted later on by general subject deletion rules 

\section{Remainig Problems}
The transformations described in the preceding section have improved the 
existing system, eliminating ill-formed sentences and adding grammatical 
solutions that were not in it before. However, there still remain some problems to be 
solved; two of them are briefly outlined below: the first one is purely 
syntactic, and its solution won't demand too much effort; the second one is 
semantic, and its solution will therefore have to wait until semantic 
features and rules get incorporated into the system

\subsection{Clitic Climbing in Impersonal SE Constructions}
Some impersonal SE constructions with infinitive complements present additional
problems if some object of the lower verb is represented by a clitic pronoun, 
since theses sentences and their personal counterparts behave differently.
The behaviour of Clitic Climbing in impersonal SE constructions varies, 
depending on the syntactic nature  of the main verb\footnote{Notice that Raising
verbs as {\it parecer} never appear in SE constructions.
\begin{fnlxam}
&&*&se parece que ahora se lee m\'{a}s que antes\\
&&&parece que ahora se lee m\'{a}s que antes\\
&&&het lijkt alsof men tegenwoordig meer zou lezen dan vroeger\\
\end{fnlxam}
Causative Verbs will pose some problems too; they will be treated on another 
occasion, since these verbs present a deviating behaviour in other 
constructions as well.}:\\

\begin{itemize} 
  \item With {\bf Subject Controller} Verbs, Clitic Climbing is usually free to
        apply optionally, as we see in (\ref{51}a,b); but in a impersonal SE 
        construction, Clitic Climbing seems to apply obligatorily, as the 
        contrast between (\ref{52}a) and (\ref{52}b)shows\\
        \begin{lxam}
        \label{51}
        &a&& Juan quiere compr\'{a}r{\it telo}\\
        &b&& Juan {\it te lo} quiere comprar\\
        &&&Jan wil dat dit voor jou wordt gekocht\\
        &&&(John wants to buy it for you) 
        \end{lxam}

        \begin{lxam}
        \label{52}
        &a&*& Se quiere compr\'{a}r{\it telo}\\
        &b&&  Se {\it te} quiere comprar\footnotemark\\
        &&&Men wil dat dit voor jou wordt gekocht\\
        &&&  ( They want to buy it for you)    
        \end{lxam}
\footnotetext{Notice that hier, the direct object pronoun, that had climbed to the 
left from the main verb, has dissapeared, ({\it Se te lo quiere comprar} would 
be ill-formed) just as in the finite counterpart {\it Se te (*lo) compra}. On 
the other hand, if Clitic Climbing does not apply, like in (\ref{52}a), the 
object clitic remains attached to the infinitive and, since the infinitive is 
not impersonal, the object clitic must appear on surface to preserve meaning: {\
sl Se nos orden\'{o} leer} ( they ordered us to read) does not have the same 
meaning as (\ref{52}a).} 
   \item With some\footnote{not all Object Controller verbs allow Clitic 
         Climbing, as shown by the contrast {\it Juan nos lo orden\'{o} leer}
         (John ordered us to read it), which is a well-formed sentence, and 
         {\it Juan nos lo invit\'{o} a leer} (John invited us to read it), 
         which is ill-formed.}{\bf Object Controller} Verbs, on the other hand,
         Clitic Climbing can apply optionally as well,as in (\ref{53}a,b); but
         in constructions with impersonal SE in the main sentence, CLitic 
         Climbing seems to be blocked, and we get a contrast between 
         (\ref{53}b) and (\ref{54}b)\\
         \begin{lxam}
         \label{53}
         &a&&Juan nos orden\'{o} leer{\it lo}\\
         &b&&Juan nos {\it lo} orden\'{o} leer\\
         &&& John ordered us to read it   
         \end{lxam}

         \begin{lxam}
         \label{54}
         &a&& Se nos orden\'{o} leer{\it lo}\\
         &b&*&Se nos {\it lo} orden\'{o} leer\\
         &&&They ordered us to read it  
         \end{lxam}                   
\end{itemize}

In order to account for these facts, the system should have a way to check the 
presence of an impersonal SE in the main sentence, as well as the syntactic 
nature of the main verb, before closing the analysis/generation of the lower 
sentence.\\

\subsection{Psych Verbs and the Impersonal SE Construction}
Psych Verbs also seem to have a deviating behaviour in impersonal SE 
constructions. A small subset of them \footnote{the verbs with a Dative Object,
following the hypothesis of Belletti \& Rizzi, adapted to the spanish data}
cannot appear in impersonal SE constructions\\
            
        \begin{lxam}
        \label{55}
        &a&&A Juan le gusta el cine\\
        &&&John likes the movies\\
        
        &b&*&Se gusta el cine\\
        &&&People like the movies\\
        \end{lxam}

        \begin{lxam}
        \label{56}
        &a&&El medio ambiente os importa a todos\\
        &&&You all care for the environment\\ 
        
        &b&*&Se importa el medio ambiente\\
        &&&People care for the environment   
        \end{lxam}
The ungrammaticality of (\ref{55}b) and (\ref{56}b) can not just be ascribed to
the fact that the underlying subject position is empty, since other ergative -not psych- 
verbs whith underlying empty subject positions as well do appear in impersonal 
SE constructions\\

        \begin{lxam}
        \label{57}
        &a&&El tren llegaba a las ocho\\
        &&&The train came at eight o'clock\\

        &b&&Se llegaba a las ocho\\
        &&&People came at eight o'clock
        \end{lxam}
Although the verbs in (\ref{55}a') and (\ref{55} b') can appear in the same alternative 
impersonal sentences as other verbs (with UNO of emptyELLOS\footnote{see 
precedent sections}), psych verbs will prefer the construction with the NP 
{\sl La gente}\\

        \begin{lxam}
        \label{58}
        &a&&A la gente le gusta el cine\\
        &&&One likes/People like the movies\\

        &b&&A la gente le importa el medio ambiente\\
        &&&One cares/People care about the environment  
        \end{lxam}                            
      
The others \footnote{ verbs with an (inherent) Accusative Object (\ref{59}) as 
well as verbs with underlying subject (\ref{60})}do accept impersonal SE 
constructions\\

        \begin{lxam}
        \label{59}
        &a&&Se entretiene a los ni\~{n}os\\
        &&&They entertain the children\\

        &b&&Se preocupa a los profesores\\
        &&&They make the teachers worry
        \end{lxam}

        \begin{lxam}
        \label{60}
        &a&&Se aborrece a los capataces\\
        &&&They hate foremen\\

        &b&&Se teme a los fantasmas\\
        &&&They fear ghosts  
        \end{lxam}        
But they present a deviating behaviour with respect to similar constructions 
with verbs from other classes, , since with psych verbs, the [+ animate] Direct 
Object must always be introduced by the Accusative preposition 'A'\footnote{notest 
that for the verbs in (\ref{59}) and (\ref{61}b), the constituent which appears in 
Object Position is the {\it Experiencer}, which can never appear without the 
preposition; that is not the case with the verbs under (\ref{60}) and (\ref{61}
c)}, despite the value of its specificity feature; the verb itself 
appears in the singular\\

        \begin{lxam}
        \label{61}
        &a&&Se recomienda a (los) estudiantes\\
        &a'&&Se recomiendan estudiantes\\
        &&&(The) Students are recommended\\

        &b&&Se entretiene a (los) ni\~{n}os\\
        &b'&*&Se entretienen ni\~{n}os\\
        &&&(The) Children are entertained\\

        &c&&Se teme a (los) fantasmas\\
        &c'&*&Se temen fantasmas\\
        &&&(The) Ghosts are feared
        \end{lxam}
 
A mechanism which would recognize a psych verb as such\footnote{this difference 
is also necessary for other phenomena, such as Aktionsart} could not only  
account for the contrast between the ungrammaticality of (\ref{61}b', c') and 
the grammaticality of (\ref{61}a'), but it could also deal with sentences like 
(\ref{55}b), giving them the form in (\ref{58}a)
