$C1 Introduction
$ This note presents a superficial survey of the productivity of English 
suffixes and prefixes. The notion productivity has two aspects: lexicon-
internally and lexicon-externally. Lexicon-internally refers to the extent
to which a morphological rule can be defined in such a way that there are
no idiosyncratic exceptions to this rule. If the formulation of such a rule is
possible, we call the rule productive. In this case the rule accounts for words
that we may take to "exist" in the language; they are part of the lexicon. 
The lexicon-external aspect of a morphological rule is the possibility of
making "new" words of the language; words that have not been included in the
lexicon yet. Rules that are productive lexicon-internally will probably also
be the rules that can produce new words. These two ways of looking at 
productivity have not been distinghuised in this survey (perhaps there is no
such distinction, anyway). The notion productivity is used here rather loosely
and the indication of the productivity of individual affixes has partly been
arrived at on the basis of the literature, partly by intuition and will
certainly be open for improvemnt.$



$C1 Prefixes
$ I will give a list of prefixes in alphabetical order, indicating the
category of the base to which it attaches, the category of the resulting
word, the meaning of the derived word and an indication of the productivity
of the prefix.$

$ According to Zandvoort, English does not have the Dutch distinction of 
separable and inseparable prefixes: _misgooien_, _misleiden_. All English
prefixes are inseparable.$


_a-_         [ a [boil]V ]A          
             adrift
             asleep

           meaning:  "the state of X-ing"     
           (X always refers to the base of the derived word)


           According to Quirk et.al. it is doubtful whether this prefix is
           still productive.


_a-_         [ a [moral]A ]A             [ a [symmetry]N ]N
             asexual


           meaning: "lacking in X", "not".
                         

           This prefix is mostly found in borrowed or noeclassical words. It may
           be rather productive lexicon-internally, but new words will probably 
           be formed by means of other prefixes such as _un-_.


_ante-_      [ ante [chapel]N ]N     [ ante [diluvian]A ]A
             anteroom

             [ ante [date]V ]V

           meaning: "before X", "in front of X"

           Not productive and will probably never be used in forming new words.
           Zandvoort observes that _ante-_ competes with _pre-_, and Quirk
           notices that _ante-_ is more learned than _pre-_ and is found
           entirely in borrowed and neo-Latin words.

_anti-_      [ anti [christ]N ]N          [ anti [semitic]A ]A
             antipope                     anti-militarist
             anti-aircraft                anti-Darwinist
 
           [ anti [war]N ]A             [ anti [clockwise]Adv ]Adv

           meaning: "against X"

           Productive prefix, new words can easily be made and the meaning
           is regular.

_arch-_      [ arch [bishop]N ]N          base N should be human
                                        (however,_archdiocese_)
             arch-enemy

                                           
           meaning: "highest X", "worst X".

           Not very productive, but new words can be made. According to
           Quirk, new formations in _arch-_ are normally pejorative in
           meaning.

_auto-_      [ auto [biography]N ]N        [ auto [biographical]A ]A
             auto-suggestion

           meaning: "self X"

           Not very productive. I don't think new words will be formed.

_be-_        [ be [medalled]A ]A        [ be [little]A ]V
      
           [ be [smear]V ]V           [ be [witch]N ]V

           meaning: According to Quirk, _be-_ has various meanings.
           To belittle means to make small, to besmear means the same
           as to smear, to bewitch certainly doesn't mean to make a 
           witch. So, the meaning is irregular. Perhaps the first
           is rather productive, but the meaning is here irregular too.
           (bewigged, bedevilled)

_bi-_        [ bi [lingual]A ]A
_di-_        [ di [pole]N ]N
_tri-_       [ tri [partite]A ]A

           meaning: "two" (_bi-_ and _di-_), "three".
                     (_bi-_ can also mean "twice": _bimonthly_)

           Not very productive. If they will ever be used to form new words,
           _bi-_ will clearly be preferred to _di-_. However, these prefixes
           will probably not be used to form new words.


_circum-_    [ circum [ambulate]V ]V      [ circum [circle]N ]N

           [ circum [fluent]A ]A

           meaning: "round", "about".

           Not very productive, will probably not be used to form new words.


_co-_        [ co [operate]V ]V           [ co [pilote]N ]N

           meaning: "with X", "joint X".


           Rather productive. Can be used to form new words.

_counter-_   [ counter [act]V ]V        [ counter [revolution]N ]N
                                        base N is abstract

           meaning: "in opposition to X", "X against".

           Rather productive. Can be used to form new words.


_crypto_-    [ crypto [communist]N ]N      [ crypto [crystalline]A ]A

           meaning: "concealed X"' "secret X".

           Not very productive, but it might be used to form new words.


_de-_        [ de [frost]V ]V            [ de [forestation]N N

           meaning: "to reverse X".
           
           Rather productive. Can be used to form new words.


_demi-_      [ demi[god]N ]N

           meaning: "half-size X", "half X", "imperfect X", "partial X".

           Not productive, new words would probably be made by means of
           _semi-_.


_dis-_       [ dis [loyal]A ]A            [ dis [like]V ]V

           [ dis [favour]N ]N

           meaning: "the opposite of X", "not X".

           Rather productive lexicon-internally, but for new formations
           _un-_ will be preferred.

_dis-_       [ dis [connect]V ]V          [ dis [coloured]A ]A
      
           [ dis [content]N ]N

           meaning: "to reverse X", "to deprive of X".

           For new formations, _un-_ will be preferred here as well.

_en-_, _em_-  [ em [body]N ]V             [ en [ rich ]A ]V
            [ en [slave]N ]V

           _en-_ is one of the few prefixes that changes the category of the 
           base.

           meaning: it has various meanings; "to make into", "to put into"'
           "to get into".

           Not very productive, will not be used to form new words.


_epi-_       This prefix is mostly added to bases that do not exist as indepen-
           dent words in English. However, there are some where the base is an
           independent word: _epicentre_, _epifauna_, _epideictic_.

           The meaning of the prefix is not regular. These words should be
           listed in the dictionary.


_ex-_        [ ex [husband]N ]N
             ex-convict
             ex-president            The base N should be a human noun

           meaning: "former X"

           Productive. Can be used to form new words.


_extra-_     [ extra [atmospheric]A ]A
             extramarital
             extraterrestrial

           meaning: "situated outside X", "not coming within the scope of X".

           Rather productive prefix. Can be used to form new words.

_fore-_      [ fore [tell]V ]V      [ fore [knowledge]N ]N

           meaning: "before".

           Not very productive, will not be used to make new words.

_hyper-_     [ hyper [critical]A ]A

           meaning: "extremely X".

           Rather productive. Can be used to make new words.

_hypo-_      This prefix is mainly added to bases that do not exist as indepen-
           dent words in English. The meaning is: "under, below normal,
           slightly". It is not very productive and will not be used to make new
           words. (examples: hypodermic, hyptension)

_in-_        [ in [sane]A ]A         
_il-_        [ il [legal]A ]A
_im-_        [ im [probable]A ]A
_ir-_        [ ir [responsible]A ]A

           meaning: "the opposite of X", "not X'.

           Quirk observes that these prefixes are generally preferred to _un-_
           in learned words of French or Latin origin, but that its use, against
           that of _un-_ has declined. 
           The prefix is rather productive lexicon-internally, the different
           forms will have to be given by a phonological rule. New words, 
           however, will be made by means of _un-_.

_inter-_     [ inter [national]A ]A       [ inter [marry]V ]V

           [ inter [action]N ]N

           meaning: "between", "among".

           Rather productive. Can be used to form new words.


_intra-_     [ intra [mural]A ]A

           meaning: "on the inside", "within".

           Not very productive. May be used to form new words, however.

_mal-_       [ mal [treat]V ]V                 [ mal [function]N ]N

           [ mal [formed]A ]A (participle)   [ mal [odorous]A ]A

           meaning: "badly"

           Rather productive, may be used to form new words.

_meta-_      [ meta [language]N ]N       
             metaphysics

           meaning: "of a higher or second-order kind"

           Not very productive, but new words may perhaps be formed.

_micro-_     [ micro [organism]N ]N

           meaning: "small"

           Productive. Meaning not always regular, though: microbiology
           doesn't mean small biology.

_mis-_       [ mis [inform]V ]V         [ mis [conduct]N ]N

           [ mis [leading]A ]A (participle)

           meaning: "wrongly, astray".

           Not very productive. I don't know if it can be used to make new
           words.

_mono-_      [ uni [lateral]A ]A      [ mono [theism]N ]N
_uni-_

           meaning: "one"

           Rather productive. For new words, _mono-_ will probably be
           used.

_mini-_      [ mini [skirt]N ]N

           meaning: "little". Quirk: A recent prefix, often used for humorous
           coinages.

           Can be productively used to form new words.

_multi-_     [ multi [racial]A ]A       [ poly [syllabic]A ]A
_poly-_

           meaning: "many"

           Rather productive. For new words _multi-_ will probably be used.

_neo-_       [ neo [Gothic]A ]A      [ neo [colonialism]N ]N

           meaning: "new, revived" Quirk: used for political, artistic, etc.
           movements.

_non-_       [ non [smoker]N ]N           [ non [conformist]A ]A

           meaning: "not" (Quirk: derivable from clause negation: non-smoker
                           is someone who doesn't smoke)

           Productive. Can be used to form new words.


_out-_       [ out [run]V ]V  Attaches to mainly intransitive verbs, to form
                            transitive verbs.
             outlive

           (Quirk subsumes this under derivation, others (Scalise, Zandvoort,
           Marchand) call this compounding)

           meaning: "to do X faster, longer. etc., than"

           Productive. Can be used to form new words.

_over-_      [ over [eat]V ]V        [ over [dressed]A ]A (participle)

           [ over [confident]A ]A  [ over [abundance]N ]N  

           meaning: "too much"

           Productive. Can be used to form new words.


_pan-_       [ pan [African]A ]A        [ pan [Hellenism]N ]N

           meaning: "all, worldwide". Quirk: Used especially with proper
           nouns for worldwide or continent-wide movements.


           Not very productive, but can be used to make new words.

_para-_      [ para [military]A ]A        [ para [normal]A ]A

           meaning: "beyond, similar to"

           Not very productive. I don't think that new words will be formed,
           but if they are, probably only in the sense "similar to".


_post-_      [ post [war]N ]A          [ post [ classical]A ]A

           [ post [fix]N ]N          [ post [date]V ]V      

           meaning: "after"

           Productive. Can be used to form new words.


_pre-_       [ pre [war]N ]A           [ pre [marital]A ]A

           [ pre [fix]N ]N           [ pre [date]V ]V    

           meaning: "before"           

           Productive. Can be used to form new words.

_preter-_    [ preter [human]A ]A  
             preternatural

           meaning: "beyond, outside the range of, more than, as".

           Not productive. Will not be used to form new words.

_pro-_       [ pro [Common Market]N ]A      [ pro [communist]A ]A

           meaning: "on the side of"

           Productive. Can be used to form new words.

_proto-_     [ proto [type]N ]N        [ proto [Germanic]A ]A

           meaning: "first, original"

           Rather productive. Can be used to form new words.


_pseudo-_    [ pseudo [science]N ]N     [ pseudo [intellectual]A ]A

           meaning:"false, imitation"

           Productive. Can be used to make new words.


_re-_        [ re [build]V ]V          [ re [settlement]N ]N

           meaning: "again, once more", "back" 

           Quirk: one of the most common prefixes of the language, occurring
           in many words borrowed from Latin and French. May perhaps still
           be used to form new words.

_retro-_     [ retro [act]V ]V      

           meaning: "backwards, back again, in return".

           Not very productive.

_semi-_      [ semi [circle]N ]N         [ semi [humorous]A ]A

           meaning: "half", "little more or better than".

           Productive. New words will probably be only formed with the second
           meaning.

_step-_      [ step [child]N ]N
             stepmother

           meaning: "denoting nominal relationship analogous to X , resulting
           from remarriage of a parent".

           Not a long list of words, but productive for the small class of
           words it can be added to. New words could only be made if new
           words for family relations would arise. 

_sub-_       [ sub [human]A ]A

           meaning: "lower than, less than".

           [ sub [way]N ]N           [ sub [conscious]A ]A

           [ sub [let]V ]V

           meaning: "beneath, lesser in rank".

           Rather productive. Can be used to form new words.

           meaning: "above, more than, better"

           Rather productive, can be used to form new words.

           [ super [structure]N ]N

           meaning: "over"

           Rather productive, but new words will probably have the first 
           meaning.

_supra-_     [ supra [national]A ]A         
             suprasegmental

           meaning: "above"

           Not very productive, but may be used to form new words.

_sur-_       [ sur [tax]N ]N

           meaning: "over and above"

           Not productive. Will not be used to make new words.

_trans-_     [ trans [atlantic]A ]A      [ trans [plant]V ]V

           meaning: "across, from one place to another"

           Rather productive. Can be used to form new words.

_twi-_       [ twi [fold]A ]A

           meaning; "two"

           Not productive. New words will be formed by means of _two-_.

_ultra-_     [ ultra [violet]A ]A
             ultramodern

           meaning: "extremely, beyond"

           Rather productive, can be used to make new words.

           meaning: "the opposite of X", "not X".

           Productive. May be used to form new words.

           [ un [tie]V ]V
             unhorse

           meaning: "to reverse action", "to deprive of"

           Productive. May be used to form new words.

_under-_     [ under [do]V ]V      [ under [privileged]A ]A

           meaning: "too little" (subsumed under derivation by Quirk)

           Not very productive. May be used to form new words, however.

_vice-_      [ vice [president]N ]N

           meaning: "deputy"

           Rather productive. May be used to make new words.

             5. abode or residence: orphanage, vicarage. (Zandvoort)

             The suffix is not very productive, the semantics is not predict-
             able. It cannot be used to make up new words. Words ending in
             _-age_ should therefore be listed in the dictionary.

_-al_          [ [approve]V al]N         V is mostly of French origin
                arrival        
                denial
                revival

             meaning: "the act of X"

             Not very productive. New words will probably rather be made
             with _-ing_.

_-al_          [ [structure]N al]A
                clinical
                algebraical

             meaning: "pertaining to X, connected with X"

             Rather productive. It may be used to form new words, attaching to
             bases ending in _ic_ , _-ion_ and _-ment_. (There are more 
             specific restrictions on the form of the bases that _-al_ can
             attach to. E.g. _-al_ never attaches to nouns ending in _-ism_.
             I will have to look at the literature to find the specific
             restrictions.

_-ant_         [ [inform]V ant]N
                disinfectant
                variant

             meaning: "someone who or something which Xs"

             Not very productive. Quirk: a less common and more learned 
             agential suffix. Will probably not be used to form new words.

_-arian_       [ [authorit(y)]N arian]A
                vegetarian
                parliamentarian

             meaning: "in the manner of X"

             Not very productive. Will probably not be used to form new words.

_-ary_         [ [custom]N ary]A         Attaches to bases of Latin origin.
                revolutionary
                visionary

             meaning: "pertaining to X, connected with X"

             Not very productive. Will not be used to make new words.

_-ate_         [ [affection]N ate]A
              
             meaning: "pertaining to X, connected with X"

             Not productive. Will not be used to make new words.

_-(a)(t)ion_   [ [fix]V ation]N
                exploration
                foundation
                organization
                creation
                confession
                transcription

             meaning: "state, action" (abstract nouns) "institution" (collect-
             ive nouns).

             Productive suffix. New words can be made b.m.o. this suffix.

_-crat_        Does not attach to existing English words.
             democrat
             aristocrat
             autocrat
             bureaucrat  

             meaning: "supporter or member of a -cracy (COD)

             Not a productive suffix. May, however, occasionally be used
             to form new words. Bauer gives _eurocrat_ as an example.

_-cy_          [ [captain]N cy]N     [ [bankrupt]A cy]N
                                       accuracy
                                       constancy
                                       
             meaning: "the quality of being X"

             Not a productive suffix. Will not be used to form new words.

_-dom_         [ [king]N dom]N    [ [free]A dom]N
                 popedom            officialdom

             meaning: "domain, realm, condition"

             Not a very productive suffix. Can be used to make new words,
             however. Quirk: -dom can add a pejorative flavour in modern
             formations, e.g.: officialdom.

_-ee_          [ [employ]V ee]N
                payee
                appointee

             meaning: "passive suffix; e.g. _draftee_ is one who is drafted.
             However, as Quirk points out, these words are not always derived
             from verb bases (_refugee_), although they do have the passive 
             meaning. Some do not even have this passive meaning: _absentee_.

             Not a very productive suffix. Will probably not be used to form
             new words.

_-eer_         [ [mountain]N eer]N       [ [command]V eer]V
                engineer

             meaning: "person engaged in an occupation or activity", or the
             activity itself.
             Often pejorative.

             Not productive. Will not be used to form new words.

_-en_          [ [broad]A en]V    

             [ [deaf]A en]V     

             meaning: transitive verb: "make more X"
                      intransitive verb: "become X"

             Quirk: Now scarcely productive. All of these verbs (added
             principally to monosyllabic native adjectives) can be used in
             the first sense, and most in the second sense as well. 
             Will probably not be used to make new words.

_-er_          [ [London]N er]N
                teenager
                glover
                
             meaning: Quirk: Varied meaning, e.g. "something having X",
             "inhabitant of X", "maker of X".

             Not very productive. Will probably not be used to make new words.

_-er_          [ [work]V er]N
                singer
                reader

             meaning: "one who Xs".


             Quirk: An extremely productive affix, potentially affixable to
             any verb in the language. 
             See also _-or_.

_-ery_         [ [devil]N ry]N      (resulting noun is an abstract noun)

             [ [nun]N ery]N       (resulting noun is a concrete count noun)

             [ [machine]N ery]N   (resulting noun is a mass noun)

          
             meaning: 1. "behaviour"
                      2. "place of activity or abode"
                      3. "collectivity"

             Zandvoort notices two additional uses of this suffix:
             meaning: "science, occupation, trade" (chemistry, dentistry).
             A special group. connected with agent nouns such as _baker_,
             as well as with verbs such as _bake_: bakery, brewery, fishery.

             Not a very productive suffix. However, Quirk observes that the
             suffix can be used in nonce-formations (new words invented by
             a speaker) in the first meaning: _nitwittery_.

_-ese_         [ [Japan]N ese]A    [ [Japan]N ese]N
                Chinese
                journalese

             meaning: "belonging to X, language of X"
             Quirk: Used normally for language and dialect names. Extended
             to linguistic styles (usually pejoratively).

             Suffix can productively be added to names of countries. The
             other use is less productive. 

_-esque_       [ [Dante]N esque]A       (base is a proper noun)
                Rembrandtesque

             meaning: "in the style of X"

             Can be productively added to names. Some words in _-esque_ are
             borrowed words: _picturesque_, _burlesque_. In these words the
             suffix is not productive.

_-ess_         [ [heir]N ess]N        (base and resulting nouns are animate)
                princess
                goddess
                stewardess


             meaning: "female X"

             According to Quirk, this suffix is used with decreasing frequency.
             Certain words are felt to be old-maidish (_authoress_) or 
             indelicate (_Jewess_, _negress_) and are best replaced by
             paraphrases. Will therefore not be used to make new words.

_-ette_        [ [kitchen]N ette]N

               [ [leather]N ette]N

               [ [usher]N ette]N

             meaning: 1. "small, compact"
                      2. "imitation"
                      3. "female"

             Not a productive suffix. Will not be used to make new words.



_-ful_         [ [mouth]N ful]N
                spoonful
                pocketful     

             meaning: "the amount which X contains"

             Productive suffix. May be used to form new words.

             [ [delight]N fulA
                useful
                helpful
                successful

             meaning: "full of X", "having X"' "giving X".

             Productive suffix. Can be used to make new words. Some derived
             words exist with verb bases: _forgetful_.


_-graphy_      Does not attach to existing English words.
             
             biography
             calligraphy
             geography

             meaning: ?

             Not productive. Will not be used to make new words.

_-hood_        [ [child]N hood]N
                motherhood
                knighthood

             meaning: "status of being X"

             Not a very productive suffix. Attaches mainly to words denoting
             family relationships. May, however, be used to make new words.
             Cf. also to _-ship_ and _-dom_.

_-(i)an_       [ [Paris]N ian]A or N     (the base is mainly proper nouns)
                Darwinian
                Elizabethan
                republican

             meaning: "belonging to X"' "pertaining to X".

             Not a very productive suffix, but can especially be added to
             proper nouns ending in -(i)a: _Persia/Persian_.

_-ic_          [ [atom]N ic]A
                emphatic  (from: emphasis)
                heroic    (from: heroism)
                problematic  (from: problem)
                Arabic       (from: Arab)

             meaning: ? According to Quirk it is impossible to specify a
             particular meaning for this suffix.

             Often not added to existing English words. Although many words
             of this form exist in English, the formation is not regular.
             Will probably not be used to make new words.


_-ify_         [ [simple]A ify]V      [ [beauty]N ify]V

             meaning: "to make X"

             Most of the existing words in _-ify_ are borrowed words and do
             not have an existing English word as base: pacify, specify,
             magnify, etc. So, not a very productive suffix. May perhaps
             be used to form new words.



_-ing_         [ [drive]V ing]N        (resulting noun is an abstract noun)
                bathing
                betting

             [ [paint]V ing]N        (resulting noun is a concrete noun)
                building
                opening
                matting


             meaning: 1. "state", "activity"
                      2. "that which results from the activity of the verb"


             The first suffix is extremely productive. Quirk says that it is
             mentioned for completeness, because it is not really a word-
             formation process but more like inflection. The second suffix
             is less productive, but may probably be used to form new words.

_-ish_         [ [Sweden]N ish]A    (Swedish)
             [ [fool]N ish]A

             meaning: "belonging to X", "having the character of X".

             The adjectives denoting nationalities or languages are not formed
             from a regular base. The suffix doesn't seem to attach 
             productively to other bases. May perhaps be used to form new words.

_-ish_         [ [green]A ish]A
                earlyish
                poorish
   
             meaning: "somewhat X"

             Productive suffix. Can be used to form new words.


_-ism_         [ [social]A ism]N
                Calvinism
                impressionism
                idealism

             meaning: "doctrine", "point of view", "political or artistic
             movement".

             Many words in _-ism_ have no bases which are existing English
             words. They often correspond to nouns in _-ist_: _communist/_
             _communism_. 
             Rather productive. May probably be used to make new words.

_-ist_         [ [violin]N ist]N        [ [loyal]A ist]N

             meaning: "member of a party", "occupation".

             Quirk: Many nouns with this suffix are borrowed, and consequently
             the base may not exist as an English noun (buddhist, nihilist,
             pacifist). Not a very productive suffix. May probably be used to
             form new words, however.

_-ite_         [ [Israel]N ite]N        (base is chiefly names)

             [ [Stalin]N ite]N
                socialite

             meaning: 1. "member of a tribe or community"
                      2. "member of a faction, sect, ot type"
                          (often pejorative)

             Not a very productive suffix. May occasionally be used to form
             new words.

_-ity_         [ [rapid]A ity]N
                respectability
                simplicity
                elasticity

             meaning: "state of being X", "quality of being X"

             The suffix _-ity_ is added to words of classical or French origin.
             It productively attaches to words in _-able_/_-ible_, _-al_ and
             _-ic_. For making new words the suffix _-ness_ will rather be used,
             except for the words ending in the above-mentioned suffixes.
         

_-ive_         [ [attract]V ive]A
                expansive
                explosive
                sensitive

             meaning: ? According to Quirk it is impossible to specify a
             particular meaning for this suffix.

             Zandvoort: English has a great many adjectives in _-ive_, but 
             though some of them appear to have been derived from English verbs
             (_attractive_, _creative_, _possessive_, etc.) or nouns 
             (_instictive_),
             the majority (like _descriptive_, _productive_, _subversive_) are
             only associated with them.
             Not a very productive suffix. Will probably not be used to make 
             new words.

_-ize_         [ [symbol]N ize]V       [ [popular]A ize]V     
                hospitalize             legalize
                                        Americanize


             meaning: "causative suffix, to make X"

             According to Quirk, this is a very productive suffix. It can be
             used to form new words.

_-less_        [ [speech]N less]A
                childless
                harmless
                painless

             meaning: "without X", "not giving X"

             Productive suffix. Can be used to make new words.

_-let_         [ [book]N let]N
                piglet
                leaflet
                starlet

             meaning: "small, unimportant"

             Unproductive suffix. Will not be used to make new words.

_-like_        [ [child]N like]A
                deathlike
                statesmanlike

             meaning: "having the qualities of X"

             Rather productive. Can be used to make new words.
             Cf. also to _-ly_.

                          
_-ling_        [ [prince]N ling]N
                duckling
                weakling

             meaning: "small, unimportant"
             Words in _-ling_ have a mildly contemptuous flavour.

             Unproductive. Will not be used to make new words.

_-logy_        Does not attach to existing English words.

             lexicology
             archaeology

             meaning: ?

             Not productive, will not be used to make new words.

_-ly_          [ [beast]N ly]A      [ [dead]A ly]A
                manly
                cowardly

             meaning: "having the qualities of X"

             Less productive than _-like_. Will therefore probably not be used
             to make new words. A special group of words in this class consists
             of those derived from nouns of time: _daily_, _weekly_.

_-ly_          [ [strange]A ly]Adv
                happily
                oddly
                delightfully
                irresponsibly

             meaning: "in an X manner"

             Very productive suffix. Following _-ic_, the suffix generally
             takes the form _-ally_: _scenically_. Will be used to make new
             words.

_-ment_        [ [arrange]V ment]N
                puzzlement
                settlement

             meaning: "state", "action".

             Not a very productive suffix. According to Bauer no new words
             can be formed by means of _-ment_.

_-ness_        [ [mad]A ness]N
                goodness
                selfishness

             meaning: "state of being X", "the quality of being X".

             Very productive suffix. The normal way of forming an abstract noun
             from an adjective, except for classical or French words, which 
             take _-ity_.


_-or_          Same suffix as _-er_, but used for borrowed and neo-classical
             words.
 
             [ [act]V or]N
                inspector

             meaning: "one who Xs"

             Not very productive. There is often no existing English word as
             base for these words: _author_, _doctor_. For making new words
             _-er_ will be preferred.


_-ory_         [ [advise]N ory]A
                obligatory

             meaning: ?

             Not productive. Will not be used to make new words.

_-ous_         [ [danger]N ous]A
                nervous
                

             meaning: ? According to Quirk it is impossible to specify a
             particular meaning for this suffix.

             There are a lot of words in _-ous_ that are not derived from
             English words: _precious_, _delicious_, _curious_, _obvious_.

             Not a very productive suffix. Will not be used to make new words.


_-ship_        [ [friend]N ship]N
                membership
                dictatorship

             meaning: "status, condition".

             Not a very productive suffix. May be used to form new words, 
             however.
             Cf. also _-hood_ and _-dom_.


_-some_        [ [trouble]N some]A
                burdensome

             meaning: ? The COD lists several meanings, this is indicative
             of the fact that _-some_ does not have a particular meaning.

             Not productive. Will not be used to make new words.

_-ster_        [ [game]N ster]N
                trickster

             meaning: "person engaged in an occupation or activity"
             This is not always the case: _spinster_.

             Not productive. Will not be used to make new words.

_-ward_        [ [sea]N ward] Adv         [ [back]A ward]Adv
                homeward                   eastward
                bedward                    upward

             meaning: "manner and direction of movement".

             Productive, though there is of course a semantic restriction
             on the base. It must be either something you can go to or it
             must indicate a direction. May be used to form new words.

_-worthy_      [ [sea]N worthy]A
                praiseworthy

             meaning: "worthy of X"

             This wordformation process is really close to compounds. It
             is not very productive, but it may probably be used to make
             new words.

_-y_           [ [meat]N y]A
                sandy
                hairy

             Productive suffix. Can be used to make new words.

-_y_           [ [dad]N y]N
                Johnny
                aunty

             meaning: Quirk: This suffix, largely restricted to familiar
             contexts, has no meaning apart from that of indicating endear-
             ment or familiarity.

             Not productive. Will probably not be used to make new words,
             except perhaps with names.
