\section{Introduction}

This report covers the fifth half-year of the Rosetta project:
the period from February 1, 1987 until August 1, 1987.

As usual the report is brief and non-technical; we 
refer to the relevant project documents for further 
information.  
In section 2 an overview is given of the activities in the past
half-year. In section 3 we discuss some organisational aspects.
In section 4 the main Rosetta documents written in this period
are enumerated. 
In section 5 an overview is given of the person-hours spent on the
project.

\newpage

\section{Activities in the period from February 1, 1987 until August 1, 1987}

We subdivide the activities into four categories: (i) formalism, (ii) software,
(iii) linguistics and (iv) miscellaneous.
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(i)]{\bf Formalism}\\

The formal definition of the Rosetta3 modules is fairly stable by now. Only
minor changes have been made. 
The only exceptions relate to 
the treatment of idiomatic expressions and of 
semi-idioms on which decisions had to be made yet. 
There have been discussions on more drastic 
changes, but their possible implementation  will be postponed until the 
Rosetta4 phase of the project.

Minor extensions to the notation of the syntactic rules (the M-rules)
have been made, due to wishes 
that came up during the actual rule writing.

There has been a discussion about alternative ways of
defining control on the order of 
rule applications (doc. R0180) and about introducing the possibility
of controlling the application of complete subgrammars as well.
However, the current control formalism works quite satisfactorily and
it was decided not to change it. 


In the morphological component two additions to the formalism have
been introduced. In the first place 
there is now the possibility to order segmentation rules 
explicitly. In this way many false paths can 
be prevented immediately in the segmentation phase of the morphological
analysis, instead of being filtered out later
during the second phase. This extension had been foreseen earlier,
but then it was decided to postpone its implementation until it
was clear that there would be efficiency problems without it, which
turned out to be the case.
The second alteration concerned the treatment of particles like `af'
in words like `onafleidbaar' (doc. R0189). Up till now particles were treated in
morphology as separate words, which is natural in sentences like `hij leidde
de formule af', and which is possible in a word like `afleidbaar' where `af'
can be seen as a separate word that is `glued' to another word, but this
approach 
causes problems in words like `onafleidbaar' where the prefix `on' precedes
the particle. By making it possible that particles are treated as prefixes and
as separate words as well, the problem could be solved.
The final morphological framework is described in doc. R0210.

Much attention has been devoted to the treatment of idioms (i.e. expressions of which the meaning cannot be derived
compositionally from the meanings of the parts, e.g. `to pull
one's leg'), especially to the way they 
are represented in the lexicon.
It has been decided that they are represented in the dictionary as syntactic 
derivation 
trees (doc. R0194). 
 
There has been a fundamental discussion about the status of
the dictionaries in the Rosetta system (doc R0201, R0205) and about a better
division of their tasks. E.g., at the moment there is one dictionary for
representing both morphological and syntactic information of words. It would be
more elegant if these sources of information would be separated. This
might also improve the efficiency of the morphological analysis. At the
moment, words with the same stem and with the same morphological properties,
but with different syntactic properties lead to unnecessary
ambiguities during analysis, which could be avoided if there would
be a separate morphological dictionary. However, it was decided that
it was undesirable to incorporate these innovations in the Rosetta3 phase of
the project and to reconsider them in 
the Rosetta4 phase.

Related to this is the treatment of semi-idioms. These are expressions like
`to make a decision', which do have compositional semantics, but which
have a main verb with a rather vague meaning, of which the actual meaning
(and therefore the translation) depends on the direct object. E.g. `een besluit
nemen' becomes `to make a decision', `een bad nemen' becomes `to have a bath'.
These phenomena will be handled by introducing a kind of context-dependent rules
in the transfer modules. 
This extension is discussed in doc. R0213. In the same document some other 
extensions
of the transfer component are discussed, which concern the way in which
various interpretations of a sentence are ordered according to
plausibility. 
This is a preparation to the Rosetta4 phase of the project, when
extra-linguistic knowledge on a restricted subject domain will be
incorporated in the system. 
 

\item[(ii)]{\bf Software}\\

During the past half-year it turned out that our computer capacity
is not quite sufficient in this phase of the project. 
Several measures have been taken to cope with this problem, such as using
the system more intensively at night. 
A new version of the software management system RBS has been made, 
which makes use
of a data base for indicating the dependencies between the modules. This 
strongly reduces the amount of overhead time in case of compilation. 
The work spent on RBS is unforeseen and has led to some delay in the 
implementation of Rosetta modules.

The development of a compiler-generator tuned to our needs that was 
mentioned in the previous report has been 
completed and the result has been fruitfully used in various rule compilers
(doc R0172). The main activity in this area has been the development
of the M-rule compiler. The syntax checker of this compiler is ready, for the
code generation a first version is ready, but some additional work will
be done in order to improve the efficiency of the resulting Pascal functions.

The implementation of the module M-PARSER is almost completed. What remains to
be done is mainly providing testing facilities and integrating the parser with
the results of the rule compiler.

The implementation of the algorithms for G-MORPH, the generative morphological
module, has been completed. In order to be able to test the morphological
rules, several tools had to be made, e.g. programs to print the morphological
trees on the screen. Provisions were made so that the 
morphological analysis module A-MORPH of a particular language 
can be coupled to G-MORPH of the same language. This facilitates the testing
of G-MORPH, because the output trees of A-MORPH can be used as input
of G-MORPH.

The extensions in the morphological formalism mentioned before (rule ordering,
the use of particles as prefixes) have been implemented.

An implementation for the Rosetta3 dictionaries has been made, with the help
of RMS, in such a way that a very large number of dictionary entries is allowed.

The work on extracting information from the Van Dale dictionaries 
has been continued. The dictionaries are currently transformed from
text files into
data bases in order to make access easier and faster. 
However, the overall impression is that the Van Dale dictionaries 
will only be of limited use to us. It was already known that only
part of the information we need is present in the dictionaries, but
even if it is present it is hard to extract it fully automatically, due
to irregularities and exceptions. 
In most cases the results have to be
inspected `by hand' and for these inspections we have little manpower
available. We will try to use the full Dutch-English Van Dale for 
the word-translator version\footnote{It may be useful to remind 
that there will be two versions of Rosetta3 (as described in doc. R0077),
the word translator (which translates not only stems but also inflected
words as far as possible) and the phrase translator (which translates 
phrases and sentences).}
of Rosetta3, because for that version
only morphological information is needed. In most cases this information
can be found in or deduced from the Van Dale tapes. A remaining problem
is that we have to merge the information of three dictionaries:
Dutch-Dutch, English-Dutch and
Dutch-English. The Dutch-Dutch and the Dutch-English
dictionaries are well tuned to each other, but the English output of
the Dutch-English dictionary cannot always be found in the English-Dutch
dictionary. The quantitative aspects of this mismatch are currently
investigated.

For the phrase-translator 
version of Rosetta3 a relatively small subset of Van Dale will be used, of which
the entries will be specified mainly by hand.
 

\item[(iii)]{\bf Linguistics}\\

{\it Morphology}

The morphological rules for Dutch and English analysis and generation
have been tested, making use of a small test vocabulary of about
200 words, especially selected for this test. In both cases relatively
few errors have been found, which gives us confidence that very
few undiscovered errors are left. The generative morphogical rules
have been tested by giving them as their input the output of
the analytical morphological module. For Spanish this was not possible, because
for that language only a generative module is made. Therefore testing
the Spanish morphology will have to wait until the other Spanish modules 
have been implemented.

All morphological rules written and tested thus far are rules for inflection. 
In a fairly early stage of the project it was concluded that morphological
derivation is in most cases too irregular (especially semantically) to
be useful in a translation system. However, for some very productive
cases, e.g. the Dutch diminutive, derivation rules will be added in the
near future.

{\it Syntax and semantics}

Most of the linguistic work in this period was devoted to the
actual writing of syntax rules. The fundamental decisions 
about the organisation of the grammars had been made before. The main 
exception to this was the representation of idiomatic expressions,
as was already reported in the section on the formalism.

For the word translator local M-rules are written for Dutch and English.
The Dutch rules have already been completed, the English rules will
be completed by September 1. 
The rules for the word translator will partially be used in the phrase
translator as well, by one of the `fail-soft' mechanisms which are put
into action  
if a phrase does not fit into the system's grammar. The last resource
in that case is to translate the separate words by means of the local rules.
  
Obviously most work was done for the grammar of the phrase translator.
Most of the M-rules for the Dutch clause have been written
now. For the Dutch noun phrase a preliminary version has been made.
Work on adjective phrases has started. All these rules are written for
both analysis and generation. For Spanish the rule writing has started too,
making use of the experience with writing the Dutch rules. 
Before the rule writing for Spanish could begin, the Spanish domain of
syntactic categories, attributes, syntactic relations had to be specified.
The rule writing for the English phrase translator will start in October.
This is later than originally planned and will delay the completion
of the Dutch-English phrase translator. This delay is mainly caused by
a change in personnel (cf. section 3).

In order to be able to test the syntactic rules, the test dictionaries for the
morphological modules are currently extended with syntactic information and with
a number of new words. 


The study on text semantics by Jeroen Groenendijk, University of Amsterdam,
has led to a nice theoretical result: a system called Dynamic Predicate Logic
has been worked out, which can be the basis of 
a discourse semantics that is both compositional and able to 
cope with discourse in an 
`on line' manner. 
The next step will be to investigate the practical usefulness of
the theory for machine translation.

Three trainees (students of linguistics) have completed preparatory studies
on syntax and semantics of time adverbials and on lexical disambiguation.


\item[(iv)]{\bf Miscellaneous}\\

In the DOOM project (ESPRIT project 415A on parallel computer architectures)
the development of a parallel
version of Rosetta, written in the parallel object-oriented language POOL,
has been continued. Some improvements have been made on the previously
designed algorithm for the surface parser. 
A parallel version of the algorithms for the morphological analysis 
has been completed now. In addition a translation of the morphological 
rules into POOL is required. For this purpose work 
on automatic translation from Pascal 
to POOL has started.

There have been contacts (informal up till now) 
with the University of Leiden (the
department of Computer Science and the department of Slavic Languages)
on the possibility of building a Russian component of Rosetta3.

Inside Philips the interest of the product divisions in the project
is rapidly growing. This concerns machine translation as such, for instance
in an office environment, as well as other applications involving
natural language processing, especially spelling correction and voice activated
type writing.

drs. M. Sanders (since March 1)            (Univ. of Utrecht)

\end{verbatim}
Student-trainees:
\begin{verbatim}
L. Kopinga (Free University, Amsterdam), until May 31, 1987.
A. Post (Univ. of Utrecht), until May 31, 1987.
N. Grygierczyk (Univ. of Utrecht), until July 31, 1987.

C. Hazenberg (University of Leiden), from February 1, 1987.

\end{verbatim}

Dr. J. Groenendijk (University of Amsterdam) 
continued his two-year study on text-semantics, financed by
Philips Research Laboratories.

Drs. M. Sanders entered the project on March 1, 1987. She is the successor
of drs. A. Mijnhout for the development of the English modules.
As we already expected, this change of personnel causes an additional delay.

Drs. A. Mijnhout, who left the project on December 31, 1986, has made 
an additional contribution to the project during 4 days in March. She 
tested the morphological rules for English she had written.

Drs. F. de Jong was absent in the first quarter of 1987 because of
pregnancy leave.

J. Stevens finished his contributions to the project in June 1, 1987.
\bigskip

{\bf Internal organisation of the project}
\bigskip

The organisation did not change in the past half-year.
There is a software subgroup consisting of: 
Rous (chairman), Fellinger, Leermakers and Medema. 

There is a linguistic subgroup, 
consisting of: Odijk (chairman), Appelo, 
De Jong, Van Munster, Sanders, Schenk and Smit.

There is a plenary project meeting twice a month, mainly devoted to
organisational matters and exchange of information. Usually this
meeting is followed by a presentation by one of the project members
on his/her work or on another topic.

The two subgroups have weekly progress meetings. 
 
In addition there are incidental meetings for the discussion of new
documents.
\bigskip

{\bf Planning}
\bigskip

In the next half-year (until February 1, 1988) 
we expect to complete the implementation of 
Rosetta, as far as the algorithms are concerned, with the
exception of some `fail-soft' mechanisms and some features to make
the system more user-friendly.
 
The local rules for the word translator (Dutch-English and English-Dutch)
will be completed and tested in this period. 

For the phrase translator the Dutch grammar (for analysis and generation) 
will be completed.
The completion of the Spanish and the English
grammars will take some more time (until April 1 1988). 
We expect that the testing of 
the Dutch-English and the Dutch-Spanish phrase translators
can be finished by the middle of 1988. 

In the next half-year report we will determine the exact completion date 
of the Rosetta3 D-E and D-S phrase translators 
and the corresponding final report.
\bigskip

The main causes of the delay - in addition to the causes already mentioned in 
the previous report - are:

- The size and complexity of the grammars needed for meeting the original
requirements (as specified in R0081) is considerably larger than expected.

- The problems with the available computer capacity and - as a consequence -
the additional work on our software management system, mentioned in section 2,
(ii).

- The departure of drs. A. Mijnhout, who was responsible for
the English grammar. Obviously, it takes time before her 
successor, drs. A. Sanders, who started on March 1, is sufficiently
trained to take part in grammar writing.
