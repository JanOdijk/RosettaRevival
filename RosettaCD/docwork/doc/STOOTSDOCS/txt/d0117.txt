$c1 Introduction

$ Among the expressions commonly referred to as NP a two-fold distinction will
be made. The distinction is expressed by two different category names:
Nomphrase (NomP) and Noun Phrase (NP). To the former category belong the
phrases that occur in predicative position, while the latter name is used for
those phrases that occur in argument-positions or as complements. Furthermore
the categories differ in that only NomPs are supposed to have an XPProp-level.
On the other hand, 
both NPs and NomPs are supposed to be isomorphic to the other
XPProp-subgrammars. NomPs share the predicative use inherent to APs,
PPs, ADVPs, etc., while NPs are not considered to be of a
propositional nature and consequently the rules of the NP-subgrammar do not
introduce a subject at any stage in the derivation of an NP. (As will be 
explained below this is not necessary in order to realize isomorphy in the 
relevant cases.)$ 
$ Not all nominal constituents can fulfil both the role of argument and the
role of prerdicate. But clearly there is an enormous overlap between the
strings that can be used as NPs and those that classify as NomPs. (Cf. appendix
A, which contains an inventarisation hereof.) Therefore it will be assumed that
the entire NP-subgrammar can be copied into the NomPProp-subgrammar. Hence the
only kind of nominal constituent that cannot occur in argumentposition, i.e.
the determinerless singular count type, will not only be generated within the
NomPProp-subgrammar but also within the NP-subgrammar. Consequently the
subgrammars that take NPs as import should block the use of e.g. `0@/\koning`
as argument by means of conditions on the relevant rules. On the other hand, in
order exclude the generation of NomPProps with `elke`, `sommige` and `de
meeste` as a determiner (cf. Appendix A), the introduction of  the subject var
should be constrained by means of conditions on determinerkeys. Also I will
assume that nominal constituents with a leftperipheric adjunct, such as `ook de
voorzitter`, `alleen een meisje`, etc., will only occur in argument-position,
so here too appropiate conditions are required to block the formation of
NomPProp out of a thus modified NP.$ 

$ In general the two subgrammars are designed according to the ideas set forth
in doc. 41, in particular with respect to 
the distinction of a CN-level. (CN is an
abbreviation for Common Noun; it can be used to refer to the head noun of an
NP, as well as to its non-maximal 
projections. Both syntactic levels refer to <e,t>-type
expressions.). Another proposal in doc. 41 concerns the assumption of the 
category DETP (Determiner Phrase). The syntactic structures discussed in doc.
41 will be repeated here schematically: (1) and (2). 
Note some NP-internal modifiers, e.g.
appositions (bijstellingen), are ignored in these trees.$

   (mod)  (mod)   head

    DETP     of   DETP

$ Note that according to the XPProp-concept and the assumptions made here
NPs might be dominated by
a NOMPProp-node and get a subject-var as a sister: (3)$

                    .........

$ Note also that the relation between the two subgrammars as sketched here,
presumes a certain ordering of the rules introducing specifiers and modifiers
into the NP. This introduiction is to take place before the introduction of a
subject on the NomPProp-level. For an extensive discussion of this assumsption,
cf. doc. 118.$

doc. 101 (Jan L.) are acknowledged. The filter transformations are not 
discussed seperately in the comment sections.$

of the various NP-classes that can function as a generic NP.$

$c2 General Comment

$ The required isomorphy of nominal constituents with other XPProp-subgrammars
has some important consequences. For example, if `be a good dancer` is to be
translated into `goed dansen`, the introduction of the modifiers `good`/`goed`
should run parallel. Under the assumptions commonly accepted in by the iso's,
this implies that the formation of a CN-like node dominating `good dancer` is
to be postponed until the stage in the derivation where the nompatternrules
have been applied already. $

$ Note that except for cases like `be a good dancer` and `goed dansen` an
isomorphic treatment is required for on the one hand sentences with a deverbal
derivation such as an `-ing` participle as the head of the subject NP, and on
the other hand sentences with a sentential subject. Compare the translational
pairs in (4).$ 

 (4) a. His dancing well annoyed her
     b. Het verveelde haar dat hij goed danste
        (?Zijn goede dansen verveelde haar)

     c. John's collapsing after the match was a surprise for his trainer
     d. Dat John instortte na de wedstrijd was een verrassing voor zijn trainer

     e. John's defeat surprised us
     f. Dat John verslagen werd verraste ons

$ At first glance the NPs in (4a,c,e) seem to have a possessive in
DET-position which functions as a kind of modifier. However, in order to
realize an analysis isomorphic to (4b,d,f) here too it is to be assumed that
nominal phrases get a derivation that is isomorphic to the derivation of
sentential clauses. This implies that the introduction of these DETs is more
restricted than for DETs preceding a nominal head that is not related in any
sense to a verbal expression, e.g. `John's` preceding `car`.  This is due to
the effect of 'subcategorization' that occurs with verbs and nominalizations.
(This terminology is meant to be neutral with respect to the particular account
or non-account that establishes the relation between verbs and nouns.)$ 
$ As uptil now it was assumed among the iso's that 
arguments are introduced before the application of modification-rules,
the possessive DETs in (4), the ones in correspondence with 
sentential arguments, are to be
introduced by a rule class that is probably to be distinguished from the set of
rules that account for the less restricted cases of modification as in `John's
car`, `auto's van John`, `fat cheese`, `yellow car`, etc. Probably 
the ruleclass RC:nounpatternrules is dispensible. Besides, given the fact that
uptil now we do not assume nounpatterns, 
there is no straightforward way to
label argument relations within the NP. Therefore I will assume NP-internal
arguments to be modifiers, which are to be introduced by RC:modargrules. 
This ruleclass deals not only with logical arguments but also with 
WH-sentential postnominal modifiers and cases like 
`students of physics` (vs. `students with red hair`), or in general 
cases where the noun puts some selectional restrictions on functional 
words, such as prepositions, complementizers, etc.
Differences in behaviour of 
modifiers to deverbal nouns (e.g. with respect to `one`-substitution, 
with respect to the selection of complementizers, or with respect to the
required translation of 
prepositions) must be dealt by suitable conditions on the rules.
(Note that the ordering of this RC: modargrules is dependent of the ordering of
rules that introduce argument vars within the VERBPProp-subgrammar.)$ 

$ In doc. 118 an alternative treatment of modification within sentences is
sketched based upon the notion head-modification. Pending a discussion on this
notion I will presume here that as only a minor set of NPs requires a
derivation which is isomorphic to clauses, at least within the NP-subgrammar
some notion of head-modification can be incorporated. For this latter type of
modification, there are three RCs: 
the RC:mod1rules, for cases like `fat cheese` and
`yellow car`; the RC:modpossrules, for modifiers that express a possessive
relation as in `John's car`; and the RC:modargrules, for modifiers that 
function as arguments to a noun that can be related a verbal expression, e.g.
`John's refusal`, or
that impose restrictions on their modifiers that resemble the restrictions that 
follow from the (syntactic) verbpatterns, e.g. `de behoefte aan rust`, 
`de vraag wie er komt`. These three RCs are the first three rule classes
within the control expression.$ 
$ Actually we might as well decide to consider them to constitute one large
rule class. There are no other criteria that distinguish these rule classes
other then the criteria mentioned above. For example the ordering of the rule
classes is arbirtrary and there is no fixed surface order in which the
expressions introduced by each of these rule classes occur. However, a decision
with respect to this alternative requires a more thorough insight in the actual
rules and the complexity of their conditions. Therefore I propose to postpone
this issue to the rule-writing-stage.$ 

$ In general attributes on NP-specifiers tend to characterize the NP as a whole
as well. For example, a WH-determiner makes an NP interrogative, and the
(in)/(a)-definiteness of a determiner or numeral is decisive for the
corresponding attribute for entire NP as well. Therefore all rules of the
NP-subgrammar that introduce expressions specified for (one of) these
attributes should percolate upwardly the appropiate attribute value in order to
guarantee that the NP is specified for these attributes too.$ 

$ A last remark concerns the analysis of NPs that lack an overt nominal head.
In order to prevent the need to formulate a huge number of category-changing
rules it will be assumed that NP's without a nominal head, such as `deze drie`,
`de te laat gewaarschuwden`, `de gele`, `de derde`, `die gerepareerde`, `die
van Jan`, `meer`, `veel`, 
etc., are derived by means of an abstact common noun, called empty
common noun (ECN). This ECN can function as the carrier of the kind of
information that is supposed to be represented in the record of the head in
other cases as well. In fact we need two different ECNs: one occurring with
[+count]-specifiers, another occurring with [-count]-specifiers. 
Unless there is a [+count, -def] determiner, such as `three` and `vele`,
ECNs  will be deleted after NP-formation. ECNs that are not deleted 
play a role role in the treatment of 
`one`-substitution and N-bar-deletion, cf. the doctoral thesis of Angeliek van
Hout. Note that the
'occurrence' of an ECN is restricted: some determiners or prenominal strings
disallow that a nominal head is absent.$ 

$c2 Comments on the various rule and transformation classes 

a. RC: mod1rules(= CN-formation)
import: `BNOUN`/`PERSPRO`/..., `CN`, APProp, NP, CLAUSE, DETP, PPProp, SENT, 
        QP, ADVPProp (specification based upon the construction list in doc. 81)
export: CN

$ This rule class accounts for the formation of a common noun level, and for the
insertion of modifiers. It is a recursive rule class, and the introduction of
modifiers is optional. The rule class is also meant to deal with the
introduction of numerals (syntactic category DETP, see below) 
for cases like `de drie
boeken`, `alle honderd deelnemers`, `mijn vele beperkingen`, etc. $ 

$ Dependent on the syntax of the specific language, some of the modifier
categories introduced by this rule class may occur before or after the head.
Some divergencies: in Dutch clausal modifiers have both options, whereas they
are bound to postnominal positions in the other languages; in Dutch and English
(most) adjectival modifiers are prenominal, whereas in Spanish they are mostly
postnominal.$ 

$ The category NP is mentioned in the import specification in view of modified
NPs with construction type indication 2.1.2.X (cf. doc. 81), including 
the pseudo partitive NPs such as
`een emmer bramen`, `een meter stof` (where `bramen` and `stof` are
considered modifiers), and the English and Spanish counterparts that
require a the occurrence of `of` and `de` respectively. It is assumed that these
particles are introduced syncategorematically.$

$ As I do not see any need to treat ECNs as basic expressions I will assume
that they will be introduced syncategorematically by the mod1rules.$ 

$ Compounds
in English and Spanish (e.g. keukentafel -kitchen table) are supposed to be
treated as fixed idioms of the category BNOUN.$ 

$ Given the huge number of syntactic categories that can be imported as
modifier by this rule class, it might turn out to be more transparant to split
it up in several rule classes each introducing specific subset of the
import set mentioned above.$ 

b. RC: modpossrules(= CN-formation), 
import: `BNOUN`, `CN`, NP (`+`proper name), VAR
export: CN 

$ This rule class, too, accounts for the introduction of modifying expressions,
but here a special kind is involved, namely modifiers expressing a possessive
relation. In order to allow an isomorphic treatment, both possessive genitives
(which occur as a DETP) as well as postnominal `van`/`of`/`de`-PPs are
introduced by this rule-class. For a thorough discussion of how the isomorphy
is realized, cf. section xx.$ 
 
c. RC:modargrules (= CN-formation)
import: `BNOUN`, `CN`, PP, CLAUSE
export: CN

d. RC: NP-formation
import: `CN`, DETP
export: NP

$ This rule class effectuates the transition from CNs., i.e. <e,t>-type
expressions into NPs, i.e. <<e,t>,t>-type expressions. In some constructions
this implies the insertion of a DETP. In case the CN contains DETP (i.e. a
numeral), the introduction of a (definite) determiner is even obligatory. (Cf.
doc. 41, p. 12, the condition on rule RNP2) But there are also several cases
where no determiner occurs in surface syntax: proper names, personal and
demonstrative pronouns, bare plurals and mass nouns, etc. Moreover, in view of
the analysis of possessive determiners, cf. section 4, it is assumed here that
the definite article occurring in non-partitive NPs is realized
syncategorematically. Possibly a syncategorematic introduction will turn out to
offer a satisfactory approach to some other translational problems as well. For
example, it is to be expected that the criteria which make an NP suitable for a
generic interpretation differ in each of the Rosetta-languages. Cf. 
Appendix B.$ 

e. TC: emptyheaddeletion
import: `NPProp`
export: NPProp

$ The sole purpose of this transformation class is to delete all ECNs (empty
nominal heads). In Dutch the deletion does not apply to ECNs
preceded by a [+count, -def]-determiner. This exception is needed
in order to account for the occurrence of quantitative `er`. The
[`+` count]-distinction is of importance here because of the fact that for
example `meer` and `veel` are ambiguous between a count-reading and a 
mass-reading. In both readings they allow an ECN, but only in the former
reading does it allow an ECN in combination 
with `er`. This ambiguity also explains why `meer` and `veel` do not always
allow a comparative as `dan drie`: (5) vs (6). 
Note also that `meer` preceding an ECN
can be
complemented by `dan` plus a full NP only if `meer` is used in the 
[-count]-reading, that is when it blocks the occurrence of `er`_[+q]_: (7).$

 (5) a.  Hij geeft er meer/veel gekocht
     b.  Hij heeft meer/veel gekocht 

 (6) a.  Hij heeft er meer gekocht dan drie
     c. *Hij heeft meer gekocht dan drie

 (7) a. *Hij heeft er[_+q_] meer gekocht dan drie boeken 
     d.  Hij heeft meer gekocht dan drie boeken 

$ The ordering of this transformation class 
as it is given here does not seem crucial. It
might as well be ordered later or earlier.$ 

f. RC: mod2rules 
import: `NP`, NP, CLAUSE, SENT
export: NP 

$ This ruleclass deals with the 
introduction of appositions (=bijstelling) and non-restrictive modification.$

g. TC: complextraposrules
import: `NP`
export: NP

$ This transformation class is meant to deal with the obligatory extraposition
of complements that may occur within DETPs dominating a QP 
(cf. the makedetprules of the DETP-subgrammar below).  
Note that the sentence initial 
direct object NP in `Meer boeken dan Jan kan ik niet dragen` contains
a discontinuous modified DETP, viz. `meer ... dan Jan`. Only after 
the introduction of this DETP by measns of the NP-formation rules 
the extraposition of the modifier `dan Jan` to `meer` can
the movement of `dan Jan` be dealt with. Note that the postnominal position need
not be the ultimate slot for this kind of modifiers. If an NP with
such a discontinuous DETP does not occur in sentence initial position, the
complements such as `dan Jan` might be extraposed again into a sentence final
position: `Ik kan meer boeken dragen dan Jan`. This latter movement is supposed
to be dealt with by a transformation class of the CLAUSE-to-SENTENCE 
subgrammar.$ 

h. TC: detadjshift (English only)
import: NP
export: NP

$ This obligatory transformation class (specific to English) deals with the
shift of determiner `a(n)` and certain prenominal adjectivess, such as `half`
and those modified by degree-modifier `too`.$ 
Examples:  a too big apple  -->  too big an apple
           a half apple     -->  half an apple
$ A reason for incorporating this TC into the NP-subgrammar and not in the
DETP-subgrammar is that in order not to complicate TC:complextraprules it
should apply after the extraposition of complements to degree-modifier `too`.$

i. RC: pre-np-modrules
import: `NP`, ADVP
export: NP

$ This ruleclass introduces leftperipheric adverbials that modify the NP 
as a whole. For example: `ook de voorzitter`, `alleen een meisje`.$

$c2 Comments on the various rule classes

a. RC: nomppropstartrules
import: `NP`, VAR
export: NPProp

$ This rule class forms NomPProps out of a NP and a VAR. The actual rules
must be constrained in order to exclude the formation of a NomPProp out
of a NP with `sommige`, `de meeste`, `elke` or its equivalents in English
and Spanish as a determiner. Presumably NomPProp-formation should also be 
excluded 
in case of measure noun as a nominal head, e.g. `drie kilo kaas`.$

b. TC: nomppatternrules 
import: `NPProp`
export: NPProp

$ This transformation class specifies the syntactic 
relation of NP and VAR to the NomPProp-head.$

c. RC: mod3rules (probably superfluous, cf. doc. 118)
import: `NPProp`, AP, ....
export: NPProp

$ This rule class is of relevance in case a sentential modifier (whether
this status is bound to Rosetta or assumed for independent reasons) 
is to be in correspondence with a modifier to an nominal expression.
Dependent on what we decide with respect to the scope of modification 
an example might be: She is a `good` dancer/She dances `well`.$

$c2 Comments on the various rule classes 

a. RC: makedetprules
import: `BDET`, `BNUM`, `QP`
export: DETP 

$ This ruleclass creates DETP-nodes. (As there are no detpatterns the
name startdetprules might be confusibg). Primarily DETP-nodes 
dominate basic expressions
such as the determiners `alle`, `de`, `sommige`, `beide`, etc., the numerals
`vele`, `enkele`, `weinige`, etc. plus the cardinals. A DETP-node can also
dominate quantifier phrases such as the simplex `meer` and `genoeg`, the
complemented `meer dan ...`, `de meeste van allemaal`, and the complex QPs
formed with the shape of an NP, such as `een (klein) beetje`. The class of
simple QPs is distinguished from the basic determiners that are traditionally
considered to be quantifiers as well, such as `alle` and `some`. The reason is
that QPs have a very specific distribution: they can also occur as degree
modifier to adverbs and adjectives, as postnominal modifier, and as predicate.
These position are not accessible to the quantifying determiners. (Probably
this distribution favours an analysis in terms of QPProp. This issue is ignored
here.)$ 
$ A special case in English is the formation of a DETP out of the complex
string `such\a`. Semantically the element `such` is a modifier
to either the nominal head (`such a fool`) or to a prenominal modifier (`such a
foolish guy`). Though this certainly is not 
accounting for this semantic role, I propose to treat the string as 
a complex basic expression, with `zo'n` and `zulke` as its translation.$

$ Numerals are supposed top be dominated by a DETP in both prenoninal positions
they may appear in. That is, in the position where a numeral functions as
(or in case of a partitive, see below: in) a determiner to the noun and where
it is a sister to node CN, and in the position where a numeral is a modifier to
the noun and a daugther to node CN. Cf. structure (1). Under this
position a NUMP-subgrammar becomes superfluous.$ 

b. RC: detpmodrules 
import: `DETP`, ADVP, DETP
export: DETP

$ This ruleclass introduces modifiers to DETP's. Both DETP's headed by a BNUM
as well as DETP's headed by a BDET can be modified. Examples: `minstens
twintig` (van de) boeken, `bijna iedere` film, `al` haar werk.
As in general is the case with
modification not every kind of modifier can be attached to any kind
of DETP. For example, `minstens` can not modify `iedere`. It is not clear to me
at the moment whether partitive DETP's that are constructed in a rule class
ordered after RC: detpmodrules can be modified as a whole. In that case tha
control expression should contain another RC for modification, ordered after
RC: partformatrules.$ 

c. RC: partformatrules 
import: `DETP`, DETP
export: DETP

$ This ruleclass combines certain kinds of DETP's into a complex DETP that in
combination with a noun might form a so-called parttitive NP. The general
scheme fassumed for partitive NPs given in (2) involves the occurrence of
`van` (Dutch), `of` (English) or `de` (Spanish) in between the two DET's
combined. This preposition-like element is not considered a basic expression.
It is to be introduced syncategorematically. $ 
$ Note that it is assumed here that of the two DETP connected by
`van`/`of`/`de` the rightmost is considered to be the head. The reason why the
RC: partformatrules do combine two DETP's instead of one DETP and one BDET (or
BNUM), or two BDET's (or a BDET and a BNUM) is the fact that both elements
independently allow modification. $ 

d. TC: detnumshift (Dutch only)
import: NP
export: NP
$ This transformation class (specific to Dutch) deals with the shift
of specifiers in the `alle de NUM N`, with as a result an NP of the shape `alle
NUM de N`. The import NP has to contain a DETP that is modified by a DETP with
`al` or `alle` and that as a whole is a determiner to a CN that is modified by
a NUM.$ 
Example: alle de drie N  -->  alle drie de N
$np
$c1 An isomorphic treatment of [VAR's N] and [de N van VAR]

$ The three Rosetta-languages differ with respect to the possibility to express
possessive relations by means of prenominal phrases with genitive case, i.e.
with morpheme `'s` (or some variant). In Spanish the genitive possessive
does not exist at all, while English and Dutch differ with respect to the
frequency of the construction. Therefore Rosetta should in general provide an
isomorphic treatment for phrases with a prenominal genitive and phrases with a
postnominal modifier expressing a possesive relation. The isomorphy should be
realized not only "between" subgrammar(s), but also within the subgrammar(s) of
Dutch and English, in order to account for the general synonymy of the scheme's
`NP's N` and `the N of NP`/`de N van NP`. In addition to the mapping of these
two scheme's, the rules should account for the Spanish construction in (8).$ 

  (8) a. El libro mio/tuyo/suyo/nuestro/vuestro
      b. Los libros mios/nuestros/... etc.
      c. Las casa(s) mio/mia/.....etc.

$ The possessive pronouns occurring in these examples syntactically behave as
if they were adjectives. Note the number/gender agreement. However, as they
correspond to postnominal PP-modifiers or prenominal determiners in English and
Dutch, and as their semantic effect is slightly more complicated they are to be
introduced by a specific subset of rules which, unlike the rules for adjectival
modification, is not to be applied more than once.$ 

$ An important aspect of the data to account for is the fact that the
isomorphy of the `NP's N` cases with the other forms is restricted to 
the examples with a definite article/determiner: `mijn/Juans boek` has the same 
meaning as `het boek van mij/Juan`, but not as `een boek van mij/Juan`. 
(Note also that phrases like
`mijn/Juans boek` behave in all respects as definite nominal phrases.)
On the other hand one would like a uniform account of the part of the NP
corresponding to `boek van mij/Juan`, irrepective of the kind of determiner
preceding this part. The present proposal attempts to realize this 
by an NP-analysis that involves a syncategorematic introduction for 
the definite article `the`. In generation this introduction is ordered after
the rules that deal with the 
formation of a CN-level, just like all other rules for the introduction 
of determiners. As the possessive relation semantically should be dealt
with on a par with other noun modifications, e.g. as expressed by adjectives,
the introduction of possessive elements is supposed to belong to the 
domain of the modification rules that precede the CN-formation. 
The following derivations are meant as a global illustration of this idea.
(Note that in view of the Rosetta approach to the introduction of NPs     
into sentences all these phrases should be generated with a VAR for the
genitive NP. Cf. the title of this section. For the sake of     
transparancy the eventual substituents i.e. `mij` and `Juan` are used in
the trees to follow.)$

$ For partitive NPs with a possessive genitive occurring 
e.g. `twee van Juans boeken`/`twee van de boeken van Juan`, this
analysis is adequate as well. Up to the formnation of CN things are fully
equal. For the introduction of the complex determiner a decision is to be made.
For the non-partitive definite cases a syncategorematic introduction of `the`,
`het`, `de` etc, is assumed. The `DETP van`-part of the partitive DETP requires
that at least the DETP, for example `twee` in the example above, 
be introduced via the introduction of a basic expression. For the formation of
partitive DETPs it was uptil now assumed that two DETPs each derived 
from basic expressions, were
involved. However, if we treat the
second determiner in the DETP as a basic expression it is to be deleted
in case we wish to generate `een van Juans boeken`. The alternative,
a syncategorematic
introduction of this definite 
determiner for the semantic equivalent `een van de 
boeken van Juan`, would require special provisions within the
the rules for the formation
of a partive determiner.  Another 
possibility is to assume an abstract definite determiner, which is to
be spelled out by a transformation of the NP-subgrammar 
under certain conditions. I propose to adopt the latter 
alternative. (Not yet incorporated in the preceding sections.)$

`Summary`
$ The NP's excluded from predicative use are NP's with one of the following
determiners: elke, sommige, de meeste.
Note that if the subject role is fulfilled bij `dit`, also the determinerless
singular count nouns are excluded from this interpretation. 
Actually the sentences with `dit` as a subject tend to have an 
"identificational" reading rather than a predicational one. However, the 
distinction can not be described in absolute terms and hence it will
not be referred here or elsewhere.$
$np
$ap B,Nominal constituent that allow a generic interpretation
$ The selection presented is based upon the ideas advocated by Carlson (1976).
That is, sentences with a generic interpretation are not considered to contain
NPs that in general are ambiguous between a generic and a non-generic reading.
Instead the generic interpretation is considered to be basic, while the
non-generic (i.e. quantificational or stage (=instantion)) reading is supposed
to be derived. Whether or not such a derivation is triggered is seen as a
matter of VP-type. The difference between the two can be compared with
the two readings for `NP rookt shag`. This type of sentence can have a
habit-reading as well as an event-reading$
