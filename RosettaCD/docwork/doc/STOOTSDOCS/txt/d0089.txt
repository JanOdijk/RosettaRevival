$c1 Introduction
$ The aim of this note is to bring some clarification in the interpretation 
of the notions `modifier` and `specifier`. As noticed in document nr. 81
(`Specification of Syntactic Constructs`) 
this intuitive distinction fails to bring about a clearcut division in the
kind of constructions that are headed by an adverb or an adverbial. $

$ From the ROSETTA  perspective, the distinction between modification and what
is 
expressed 
by specifiers, sometimes 
called 'determination', might be of importance under the
specific view to the isomorphic grammar approach as discussed in Doc.
67 (Subgrammatica's en regelklassen). Given this approach 
the piece of grammar dealing with adverbial
phrases and adjectival phrases is required to be isomorphic to the clause
grammar, in order to account for the `graag`-`like`-mapping.
Now if there is a relevant semantic
distinction between modification and determination it must be 
guaranteed that
modifiers to (verbal) clauses are translated into modifiers to adverbial
and/or adjectival constituents, and also that determination 
is translated into determination.$

$ In order get a better feeling for how to categorize 
pre-head adjuncts, a relevant subset of the AdvP/AdjP-constructions 
listed in section 5 of 
Doc. 81, especially the degree-words 
will be analyzed in some more detail. The sections 2 and
3 give some prelimanary terminology. Section 4 contains a list
of the constructions taken into consideration, while 
section 5 is addressed to a discussion of 
two competing analyses within the framework of X-bar theory:
Jackendoff (1977) and Bresnan (1973). The sections 6 and 7, which can be read
independently of section 5, will show that from the Rosetta-perspective
the notion of determination is not a prerequisite and that 
a notion of typed modification suffices to deal with the relevant
data. $
$np
$c1 The specifier-concept

$ Within classical X-bar theory the term specifier is 
used to refer to a subset of potential adjuncts in the following way: 
"Chomsky uses the term 'specifier' to refer to the material to the left 
of the head. [...] Chomsky considers 'specifier' to represent a syntactic 
category." (Jackendoff (1977:37)$

Jackendoff's own interpretation of the term 'specifier' seems more neutral:
$ "However, there is to my knowledge no evidence that either complements or
specifiers function as constituents. [....] I will use the term specifier for
expository convenience only." (o.c.:37)$ 

$ "Rather 'specifier' is simply an abbreviation for a concatenation of nodes".
(o.c.:40)$

$ Among the set of specifiers as perceived by Jackendoff are the sentential 
subject and the auxiliary. As a separate subset Jackendoff discusses
"the specifiers to NPs, APs and PPs: determiners and expressions 
of quantification and degree." (o.c.:103)$

$ Only a subset of the specifiers is categorized as [+Det] and accordingly
suppossed to express determination. Among these determiners to NP Jackendoff
reckons: articles, demonstratives, a subset of the prenominal quantifiers.
(Their syntactic category name is Art.) Moreover, Jackendoff uses the feature
`+`Det to pick out a special class of adverbs, the 'degree words' `so`, `too`,
`as`, etc. This category is called 'Degree'. ("[T]his choice primarily depends
on parallellisms between Art and Deg." (p.33))$ 

$ Prenominal adjectives are not supposed to express determination. In fact they
are not even considered to be a specifier. Jackendoff considers
them complements, as in some languges adjectives occur to the left of
the nominal head.$

$ Apparently X-bar-theory does not explore a 
claercut semantic criterion that distinguishes specifiers
from other adjuncts. But more semantically orentied approaches exhibit
almost the same vagueness in this respect. The only transparent case of 
determination is the one that occurs in NPs. Within 
Montagovian frameworks NP-determiners are usually characterized
by a semantic type which implies 
that the adjuntion of a determiner to a nominal projection entails a shift
of type <e,t> into type <<e,t>,t>.$

$ In the following the notion of determination is used in the
interpretation set forth by Jackendoff. That is, it is supposed to 
refer to the contribution to phrase structure of expressions adjoined
to the maximal projection of NP, PP and especially the degree-words
occurring within AP and AdvP.$

$c1 The notion of pre-head modification

$ Though I do not know of any formal definition of what is understood
to be a modifier within generative syntactic theory, one
property seems to be  generally accepted: 
modifiers do not affect the distribution of a phrase. Other features 
might be
that modifiying categories are recursive, as the rules that introduce them 
apply in a recursive way.$

$ Within semantic frameworks the notion of modification corresponds to 
certain semantic types. Semantic types assigned to modifiers always 
pattern as 
<a, a>, where `a` can be any simple or complex type. This too 
reflects the characteristics assumed for modifiers.$

$ Commonly a distinction is made between restrictive and unrestrictive 
modification. But this distinction has no systematic consequences for the 
syntax of modifiers and neither does it require a refinement of the 
semantic typing <a, a>.$

$ From the characteristics mentioned above, it would follow that prenominal 
adjectives are modifiers, while prenominal determiners are not.
For example, the distribution of `this car` is identical to that of
`this speedy car` 
as both strings count as an NP. But `this speedy car` and `speedy car`
are not of the same category suggesting that the occurrence of
`the` alters the distributional 
possibilities of an NP.$ 

$ As suggested in the preceding section on specifiers, Jackendoff does
not pay any systematic attention to the notion of modification. But
as will become apparent in section 4 he refers to it frequently for
non-adjectival expressions. Rather confusing is his usage of the term 
'degree-modifier' which in view of Jackendoffs remarks on the determiner
status of degree-words suggest that modifiers do not constitue a syntactic 
category. May be additions like `degree`  should be 
taken as reflecting a the restrictive nature of the modification.$

$ Anticipating a more detailed discussion of Jackendoff's analysis of the
adjunction within APs and AdvPs, (1) 
offers a schematic representation reflecting
Jackendoff's Uniform Three Level Hypothesis and his assumptions as presented
above. All constituents are XP'''-expressions. QP-modifiers, e.g. intensifiers
like `very` and measure phrases 
are supposed to occur as daughter of XP'', while other specifiers, i.e.
determiners and degree-words occur as daughter of XP''' and are represented as
Deg:$ 

$rl 3
(1)             XP'''
$ld 3 
            Deg    XP''

$c1 AdjP/AdvP constructions

$ This section consist of a listing of the relevant data of assembled in
section 5 of the external specification (doc. nr. 81). As for the distinction
between modifiers and specifiers the peculiarities of AdjP-complements and the
`though`-construction, numbered with initial 4.2 and 4.4 respectively, can be
ignored here. Hence attention will be focussed on the constructs numbered with
initial 4.1, 4.3, 5.1 and 5.3. The following selection will be discussed here:$

$ Note that instead of typically adjectival words like 
`klein` also bicategorials such as
`lang` and adverbials like `vaak` might be inserted for X.
Note also that the translation of Dutch and English measure phrases seems
rather complicated. This problem will be ignored here. Anticipating a more
detailed investigation it will be assumed that measure phrases, i.e. specifiers
with a head noun denoting a measuring unit, are modifiers. This in view of the
correspondence of `drie meter` in `drie meter lang` with the posthead modifier
in `een lengte van drie meter`.$
$np
$ The connection of the above constructs 
might become more transparent if one is
aware of the following paraphrases which stress the fact that some notion of
'grade' is involved.$

$ld 4
$ It is shown in (4) that the occurrence of complements 
does hardly correspond to any systematic aspect of the paraphrases. The only
regularity is that occurrences of `dat`/`that`/`que`-complements, which are
triggered by `zo`/`so`/`tan`, correspond to a paraphrase with `zulke`. The
paraphrases for specifiers that do not trigger complements, e.g. `hoe`, `te`,
`zeer`, are not systematically distinguished from the paraphrases for e.g.
`even`. Also there is no indication that the above mentioned criteria to
distinguish determiners from modifiers would bring about a subdivision: on the
one hand it is hard to adjoin more than one specifier to the same Adj/Adv-head.
(Embedded specifiers are disregarded here.) 
That is, they do not allow stacking, so they do not resemble (restrictive)
modifiers in this respect. But on the other hand their adjunction does neither
affect the distributional possibilities of the Adj/Adv-projection, nor 
does it entail a shift in the semantic type of the resulting phrases,
 as is the
case with e.g. NP-determiners. Moreover, some of the specifiers that trigger
complementation can be paraphrased by means of a post-head adjunct that 
together with the complement constitues a phrase that resembles other
post-head unrestrictive modifiers. 
E.g. `Hij komt vaak, zo(danig) dat het soms verveelt`.
Therefore an unrestrictive modifier status would do justice to at
least part of the peculiarities of the of specifiers under consideration.$

$ All in all the obvious properties of Adj/Adv-specifiers do not offer 
any crucial argument to decide on their status. But notice that (4) provides
intuitive grounds to assume an abstract degree-unit will play a role of
importance within the interpretation of these specifiers. Also note that 
intensifier `veel` is a QP modifier and according to the intuitive paraphrase
in (4) `zo` could be equivalent with `zo veel`. (This is because `veel` is in
correspondece with `hoge`, and `zo` with `zulke hoge`.) In `zo veel` `zo` would
be a determiner to `veel`. This equivalence of `zo` and `zo veel` would
predict a modifier-status for `zo` as well. A modifier-status for 
`zo`/`so`/`tan` would allow an account of the `dat`-complementation as 
a phenomenon triggered by a unicategorial expression.  Cf. also the sections
4 and 7.$
$np
$c1 Two approaches
$c2 Jackendoff (1977)

$ As observed by Jackendoff, 
both AdjPs and PPs "can be `modified` by a measure phrase" (p. 137).$
For example: two feet long
             seven miles down the road

$ In PPs, the modifying role can also be fulfilled by a QP instead of by a
measure phrase. For example: far down the road.$

$ Such QPs can also occur in APs. For example: more beautiful. The question is:
what is the status of expression such as `more` in these examples.  Bresnan
takes `more` as a QP and she assigns QPs occurring as A-adjuncts 
the same status as QPs in PPs: she considers them to be QP-modifiers.$ 

$ Jackendoff rejects Bresnan's approach under reference to the ungrammaticality
of *`much long` en *`little long`. His rejection enforces him to give an
alternative account for cases like `more beautiful` and `less beautiful`:
"usually adjectives do not take quantifiers and [...] `more`  and  `less` are
not quantifiers, but arise from a different source". (p.142) This source is the
node stipulated for degree-modifiers which is the X'''-daughter Deg, 
a special instance of determination. APs are supposed to have a
Deg-position available in the Det-position, i.e. the position dominated by
A''', for words like `more` and `less`. The former may be spelled out as `-er`
in case of comparatives like `longer`. (Another position that is frequently
occupied by a degree-modifier is the specifier position in QPs. For example: so
much, too many, [_PP_[P''[_QP_[_Deg_\so]\far]\down\the\road]].) $ 

$ The category Deg itself is also branching and allows for example the
occurrence of a QP-modifier, as in [_AP_[_Deg_[_QP_much] more] [A''vivid]]. For
incorporated comparative cases like `much longer` the following source is
available: [_AP_[_Deg_[_QP_much] more][_A''_ long]]]. Note that according to
this analysis recursion in the pre-adjectival structure is expected to be 
situated in the specifier of the AP.$ 

$ According to Jackendoff at least the following set of degree-words should be
considered as Det-adjunct:$ 
{as, so, too, how, more, less, most, least, this, that, enough, ... } 

$ Jackendoff's analysis can be applied to the sample of patterns listed above.
The results are assembled in (5) 
here in three columns. The first gives the
pattern, the second specifies the analysis under Jackendoff's proposal and 
the rightmost pattern 
gives a more abstract characterization which generalizes over the 
various categories that can function as determinator (D) or modifier (M).
In case of embedding a complex characterization of the format
(X, Y, Z,  ) is given. The interpretation hereof is such that Y is meant to
indicate an adjunct of the category Y to the projection of X; Z is meant to
indicate an adjunct of the category Z to the projection of Y, etc.$

$c2 Bresnan (1973)

(NB. The main source for the ideas of Bresnan(1973) has been Jackendoff (1977.)
$ As Bresnan presumes that APs can have a QP modifier her analysis of this set
of does not run parallel to that of Jackendoff. A QP-status for `more`, `much`,
`little` and `less` enforces a QP-status for elements that are in complementary
distribution with these adjuncts (or at least a status that allows insertion in
a daughter-of-X''-position) such as `so` and `as`. Because intuitively `so` 
and `as` are not quantificational this is a weird consequence. However, 
the solution is straightforward: the QP-status need not 
be assigned to the lexical elements itself, but can also be derived
by `much`-deletion:$ 

   [_QP_ so much] small   -->  so small 
   [_QP_ as much] quick   -->  as quick

$ This analysis would account for the intuition that the use of `as` and
`so` involves some notion of degree. Furthermore Bresnan assumes that recursion
of QP goes via the QP-determiner.
Applied to our selection of data the approach of Bresnan yields the following
analyses:$

$ As indicated by the question marks it is not 
fully determined what status should be assigned to `hoe`/`how`.
To begin with, `hoe` is ambiguous between an interrogative 
reading and a non-iterrogative reading. The latter will be assumed to
occur in 'How weak this argument might turn out to be, ....' or in 
'How sweet a girl'. The former is the one to focuss on here. As 
interrogative statements with initial `hoe/how X` are answered by an echo-
statement the adjunct corresponding to `hoe/how` is most probably  a
measure phrase, or an intensifier(phrase) such as `zeer`. For example:$

How old is Bill? Bill is thirty nine years old. 
How tall is the wall? The wall is ten feet tall.
How ill is Bill? Bill is very ill.

$ If we take these examples to be indicative for the status of `hoe`/`how`,
they are to be regarded as QP-modifiers 
(i.e. X''-daughters) according to Bresnan.
(Note also that in Jackendoff's approach, which suggest a specifier status for
`how`, they actually should be assigned a double status because measure phrases
and intensifiers classify differently.)$

$ In view of the problems in Doc. 81 mentioned in the introduction 
analysis J seems to have  the one conceptual advantage:$
$ the occurrence of complements is contingent on the occurrence of a
   expressions out of one category, viz. Deg-specifier, which is either 
   immediately dominated by XP or is  part of a complex XP-specifier.$

$ Under B(resnan's approach) this generalization cannot be made. 
Note however that undoubted modifiers like `sufficiently` allow
complementation too. Hence it might be argued that complementation 
has no connection with syntactic status. So the question is whether the
two approaches provide any evidence for a 
distinction between determination and modification at all.
Note that analysis B assumes a determiner status for QP-adjuncts only, while it
assigns a modifier-status to the set of
Adv/Adj-adjuncts. But nothing seems to bear on the determiner status for 
degree-words, whether embedded or not, like `so` and `too`. In fact a uniform status for all the 
expressions examined here seems to complicate neither 
the analysis nor the translation.$

In the next section where the analyses discussed here will be
applied to the `graag`/`like`-data, it will be shown to be an adequate if all
adjuncts are treated as belonging to one and the same category. $

$ In a translational system  the following mapping of sentences should 
be realized:$

a. V `te` graag                  M  D             like to V `too much` 
c. V `heel` graag                M  M             like to V `very much` 
d. `zo` graag V (dat)            M  D             like to V `so much` (that) 
g. liev`er` V .. (dan ..)        M  D             like `more` to V (than...) 
h. `veel` liev`er` V .. (dan ..)   M  D             like `much more` to V .. (than ..) 
k. `even` graag V (als..)        M  D             like to V .. `as much` (as ..) 
l. `hoe` graag V                 M  M             `how much` like to V 

$ Apparently the English degree-phrases that correspond to the degree-adjuncts 
in Dutch
are AdvPs that traditionally are considered to be (VP-)
modifiers, while the status to be assigned to 
the degree-words in Dutch is dependent on the 
specific analysis adhered to.$

Under J(ackendoff's proposal) there are two questions to deal with:
(1) What to do with the mapping of `te` ,`heel`, `zo`, `even` and `hoe` 
    on `too  much`, `very much`, `so much`, `as much` and `how much` 
    in a, c, d, k  and l?
(2) How to distinguish between modification and determination in verbal 
    clauses?
$ Under B(resnan's proposal) 
question (1) arises too, but if it is assumed that 
both `very much`, `so much`, `as much` and `how much` 
modify a verbal clause, (1) is much simpler too solve under B than under J.
With B the problem is resticted to the role of `much`, whereas under J
there is the additional problem  of d and k, which 
would require the mapping of  determiners (`te`,`zo` and `even`) onto 
modifiers (`too much`, `so much` and `as much`).
Problem (2) does not arise under B. All mappings of specifiers to `graag`
are mapping of modifiers onto modifiers.$

$ As the notion of determination in verbal clauses is not well defined, neither
syntactically nor semantically, I propose to consider the degree-phrases in
verbal clauses as modifiers. Consequently any analysis that distinguishes
between determination and modification -whatever these terms are meant to
imply- within the set of degree-words should be rejected 
as it would require
the mapping of determiners on modifiers or vice versa.$ 

$ Irrespective of the question on the exact status of the specifiers in (8)
mapping, we are forced to account for the mapping of simple expression such as
`zo`, `even` etc, -let's call them degree-modifiers, abbreviated as degmod-
onto `so much`, `as much`, etc. Schematic: [_ModP_ degmod] --> [_ModP_ degmod
much]. This can be realized in various ways. First it can be realized by
assuming a complex source for the Dutch degmod's. That is, as is proposed by
Bresnan (cf. section 5.2) and as represented in (9), we might assume that
degmod's occurring as modifiers to `graag` are analysed as complex expressions
consisting of an adjunct to MUCH (or VEEL) which is considered a(n abstract)
head that is suppressed in Dutch surface structure.$ 

$ The embedded 
adjuncts e.g. `zo` and `heel` are translated into English adjuncts
e.g. `so` and `very`, and the head MUCH is translated into `much` (or into
MUCH, which in turn is realized as `much`). In (9) the status assigned to
these adjunts is the one that Bresnan assigns to QP-specifiers: 
Deg, i.e.  determiner. 
However, nothing would argue against a modifier status for these expressions.
Note that in (9) the role of the
(two) argument VARs is left implicit. The derivations in (9) refer to fictive
names of the assumed rules. The indexing is familiar to the counting of 
projections in X-bar-theory but should not be assigned any formal status here.$

   heel    MUCH                               very   much        like
           

$ The reverse solution, represented in (10), would be to consider `zo`, `even`,
etc. as modifiers to ADvP, to translate them into their English counterparts,
and to insert `much` during the English generation as a syncategorematic
expression.$ 

$rl 6

         RADVn        heel graag                  RCLm   like very much

    heel         graag                        very      like

Which of these strategies is to be preferred depends on:
- The syntactic category desired for the involved expressions. In (9) and (10)
  this category is Deg and Mod, respectively. 
- A comparison of the results in (9) and (10) with the analysis required for
  AP's like `zo klein`, `te klein` etc. on the one hand, and with the Spanish
  data on the other hand.

$ A decision on the Deg/Mod-issue would require  a repetition of the preceding
discussion on the status of the specifiers to   Adv's and Adj's. And apparently
this would not yield crucial evidence, hence the former issue will be
ignored. The next section will be addressed to the latter issue, i.e.
the question whether we need an abstract modifier MUCH in order to account for
the modification in verbal clauses, AdvPs and AdjPs. 
Pending this discussion a first conclusion can be drawn: all specifiers
to `graag` should be classified as modifiers.$

$c1 The need for an abstract MUCH
$ In view of the question whether we should assume an abstract modifier
to account for the translation of some of the 
modifiers consider the following equivalences:$

(11)  klein                small              pequeno
      `te` klein             `too` small          `demasiado` pequeno
      `heel` klein           `very` small         `muy` pequeno
      `zo` klein             `so` small           `tan` pequeno
      klein`er`              small`er`            `mas` pequeno
      `even` klein           `as`  small          `tan`  pequeno
      `hoe` klein            `how` small          `qua@'n` pequeno

$ These modified AdjP's indicate that a derivation of `heel`, `zo` etc.
from a source with an abstract head is not motivated by their behaviour
as Adj-specifier. Neither for the mapping onto English nor onto 
Spanish would a direct interpetation and mapping violate the isomorphy-
principles, while a less superficial
translation by means of MUCH is complicating the AdjP-grammar, as well
as the AdvP-grammar. If in addition the modification in verbal clauses
in Spanish is taken into consideration, the arguments favouring an
approach in which English `much` is a basic expression become even weaker.
In most cases single 
modifying expressions in Dutch, e.g. `heel` in `heel graag`,
to single Spanish expressions, e.g. `mucho` in `Le gusta mucho nadar`.
A wider set of examples can be found in Doc. 92 (Jan Odijk).$

$ Given these observations, the superficial analysis represented in (10) seems
preferrable, in spite of the fact that it does not account for the intuition
that the expressions under consideration are accompanied by an implicit
degree-unit. Note that this conclusion is meant to hold with respect to
specific set of data. Further research is required to decide on the issue
whether in general degree-modification should be treated superficially or by
means  of one or more abstract tranlations. The latter strategy might be useful
in view of the fact that a correct translation of modifiers, in particular of
intensifiers, is highly dependent on the context in which they occur. $ 

$c1 Conclusion
1. All specifiers to adjectives. adverbs and verbal clauses are to be 
   classified as modifiers.
2. Within the set of major categories determination is a phenomenon restricted 
   to NP's.
3. For the translation of degree-modifiers no abstract degree-unit is needed.
4. Verbal modification in English sometimes is requires the syncategorematic
   introduction of `much`.
 
$ It might be of use to keep in mind that several types of unrestrictive
modification are involved:$

1. Interrogatives: e.g. `hoe` and `hoeveel` in `hoe klein`
                                        in `hoeveel kleiner`
2. Measure Phrase (MP)-modifiers: e.g. `drie meter` in `drie meter lang`
                                       `drie meter` in `drie meter te lang`
                                       `drie meter` in `drie meter langer`
$hr 3,\
$   MP-modifiers are characterized by the fact that they do allow 
neither complementation 
nor modification. (Note that `bijna` in `bijna drie meter lang` is a modifier
   to the numeral.) Therefore  `veel` (and `iets`) 
   which occurs in (b) and (h) is
   not considered aMeasure Phrase. Note that the criteria given here are
   satisfied by the interrogatives as well.$
3. Intensifiers: e.g. `heel`, `veel` and `zeer` in `heel klein`
                                          in `zeer klein`
                                          in `veel minder klein`
$hr 3,\
$ Intensifiers are characterized by the fact that they do 
   allow modification, while
  they do not trigger the occurrence of complements.$
4. Compl-triggers: e.g. `zo`, `meer`, and `even` in `zo veel kleiner`
                                              in `meer voldaan`
                                              in `even groot`
       
$ Note that as a consequence of this proposal determination does not belong to
the set of XP-operations that are supposed to have a counterpart in the
subgrammars for each of the values of X. Of the categories that seem to reflect
it in a clearcut way, NP and QP, only NPs are supposed to be handled by a
grammar organized isomorphic to the other subgrammars, so that in fact the
question is: does it happen to be the case that determination in an NP is to be
mapped on an operation to one of the other XPs? This issue requires 
further investigation.
