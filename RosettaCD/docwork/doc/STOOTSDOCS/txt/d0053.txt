$ This is the approved version of document 53. Remarks made in the discussion 
of 
it in october 1986 have been incorporated, but it does not differ very much 
from the concept version (date 18-8-86). It was approved as a basis for the 
approach to the translation of temporal expressions in Rosetta3, but as it also 
raises many questions and discusses ideas for further research (e.g. section 
7), the preliminary proposal made in this document probably will be elaborated 
and modified before Rosetta3 will have been implemented.$
$TI 0.Introduction
$ This document will contain a first, preliminary proposal for the treatment
of temporal expressions in Rosetta3, i.e. mainly
a proposal how to treat tenses and
time adverbials (of category ADV, PP and NP) in main sentences. However,
also some first ideas and proposals
about habitual aspect,
the treatment of time conjunctions (adverbial clauses), relative and
complement clauses ("supertense"), the modality of future time and the
treatment of time in texts will be discussed. Ideas about
frequency and other
quantificational or modal aspects that are related to time will only be
taken into account very incidentally.$
$ The most relevant changes with respect to the time rules of Rosetta2 will be:$

$ 1) the account of the relation between tenses and adverbials that was missing
in Rosetta2, as
it is a well-known fact that the translation of temporal
expressions in natural
languages is not a simple mapping of verbal tenses. 
In (1), for example,
the Dutch Simple Present Tense is used while in (2) a Present Perfect
Progressive Tense is the most appropriate tense to represent the time
meaning of (1) in English. A more literal translation of the Dutch Simple
Present is sometimes considered to be ill-formed, as illustrated by (3). But
in other cases that translation yields a perfect result, as shown by 
the pair (4)/(5).$

     (1) Jan woont hier al 20 jaar
         (Dutch: John-lives-here-already-20-years)
     (2) John has been living here for 20 years
     (3) * John is living here for 20 years

     (4) Jan woont hier  (John-lives-here)
     (5) John is living here

$ 2) A better definition of translation relevant aspects of time which are
reflected by the IL; the generative and analytic transfer component will not
be asymmetric anymore as it was in Rosetta2:$

                              "o.t.t."
            o.t.t.         "simple present"        Simple Present

$ 3) The addition of Spanish$

$ 4) A new strategy in the M-grammar: a compositional
approach to time that leads
to a set of M-rule classes with a certain control instead of one M-rule class.$

$ 5) A different set of "temporal attributes" for clauses and verbs.$

$ 6) The addition of a set of "temporal attributes" for most of the
other main categories and their
projections.$

$ 7) The introduction of two abstract adverbials.$

$ 8) The substitution of the clause attribute
"supertense" by an attribute "superdeixis".$

$ 9) The imperative tense forms are not handled by the temporal rules.$

$ 10) The introduction of the passive auxiliary verb, reflexive pronouns and
particles should be handled elsewhere.$

$ 11) Agreement of subject and verb form (number, person and gender) is handled
elsewhere too.$

$ In section 1 I will give a short summary of the treatment of tenses and
adverbials in Rosetta2 (to be able to understand the differences).$
$ Section 2 presents a theory of time in the Rosetta
framework which serves as the background and motivation for the actual proposal
for grammars for temporal expressions that will be given in section 3.$
$ In that section the specification of a "grammar for temporal expressions"
(in simple main sentences)
is given, discussing$
$ a) the S-trees with the changes with respect to the
temporal
attributes,$
$ b) the abstract adverbials,$
$ c) the implications in other
subgrammars,$
$ d) the rule classes for the three
languages,$
$ e) the transformations needed and$
$ f) the control.$
$ Section 4 illustrates this proposal with some examples.$
$ Section 3 and 4 treat the translation problem of temporal expressions as if it
were an isolated problem. The solution given in these sections is based on the
one presented in M.S. 13.677.
In section 5 attention is paid to habitual aspect.
In section 6 is indicated how the proposal of section 3 can be
incorporated in the Rosetta3-M-grammar scheme that is under development by the
iso-group. This involves primarily the scope of temporal adverbials, the place
of the temporal grammars in the scheme and the possibility of "not having time"
or "habitual aspect"
for certain clauses.$
$ Some first ideas and proposals for temporal expressions in
adverbial, relative and complement clauses are discussed in section 7.$
$ Remaining
problems such as the interaction between modality
and time ("future tenses" e.g.) and prospects for
frequency aspects will be
discussed in section 8.$
$ In section 9 the implications for the morphological component and the
dictionary for Rosetta3 are summarized.$
$ In section 10, finally, the place of the treatment of the imperative tense
forms,
agreement, the passive auxiliary verb, the reflexive pronoun and the particle in
the preliminary scheme of the isogroup is indicated.$
$NP
$TI 1. Summary of the Rosetta2 treatment
$ In Rosetta2 time was expressed by a set of rules (the time rules)
which spelled out the
"tenses" of a clause.
(What is meant by "tenses" and how the rules worked in Dutch
can be found in JanL(9, 16, 28).)
Time adverbials were not distincted from other adverbials
systematically and just treated like all other adverbials, i.e. they were
translated locally, a treatment that did not always lead to correct
sentences or translations as is illustrated by the examples (6) - (15):$

           (6)  *Gisteren zal hij werken

(6) is accepted as a good sentence by Rosetta2.

           (7)  Hij heeft gisteren gewerkt

           (8)  He worked yesterday
           (9)  *He has been working yesterday
           (10) *He has worked yesterday

(7) translates into (8) - (10). However, (9) and (10) are not correct English
sentences.

            (11) Hij werkt morgen

            (12) He will be working tomorrow
            (13) ?He is working tomorrow
            (14) He will work tomorrow
            (15) *He works tomorrow

$ (11) translates into (12) - (15). (15) is wrong and (13) is doubtful.$

$ The rules did not deal with
the time relation of sentences to context sentences,
or "subsentences of time" (temporal adverbial clauses), but
the relation between main sentences and
complement sentences was accounted for
by an attribute called "supertense",
taking also into
account the possibility that infinitive complement sentences must or can
sometimes
be translated
in finite ones:$
 
           (16) Hij zag het gebouw instorten
           (17) He saw that the building collapsed

$ (17) is one of the translations of (16).$

$ In the English
grammar a relation between Aktionsart (activity,
non-activity) and progressivity was taken into account to avoid e.g.:$

           (18) *He was being a tall man

$ Only grammars for Dutch and English were written.$

$ All rules which
introduced a tense had an equivalent in the interlingua, i.e. 
every tense of a language was represented in the interlingua (IL). This means
that the IL contained an expression for "o.t.t." and one for "Simple Present".
The generative transfer mapped every IL-expression to a target language
expression. Unfortunately, the IL became rather redundant in this approach
and adding a language to the system would always
cause more such redundancy, because every language would add
its own
tenses. Moreover,
the relation between the interlingua and the generative and analytic
transfer component of a language became asymmetric.$

example:

      o.t.t.                   o.t.t.               Simple Present Tense

                            simple present

$ There were separate rules for the imperative tense forms, which seem more
expressions of "mood" than of "time".$
$ In the time rules also the passive auxiliary verb, reflexive pronouns and
particles were introduced and the agreement of subject-verb form was treated
which do not have anything to do with "time", but interact with what is
understood by "tense", the morphological form of the verb.$
$NP
$TI 2. A Time Theory for Rosetta
$ 
A linguistic analysis of temporal expressions, in a framework
with an interlingua, requires some level of representation that is 
"neutral" with respect to the morpho/syntactic means for expressing time 
in natural language. In this section I will try to elaborate such a level
of representation which should serve as background and motivation for the
grammars proposed in section 3. The notions I will discuss in the sequel
are based on analyses
put forward in e.g. Reichenbach (1947),
Comrie (1976), Van Eynde e.a. (1985), Oversteegen and Verkuyl (1985),
Bruce (1972), De
Vuyst (1983).$
$ I will first give a survey of what is meant by
"the temporal expressions" (section 2.1), then give
an - informal - account of what is generally understood by a "time model"
(section 2.2.) and
finally, discuss a time model for Rosetta and motives for a certain strategy
in the grammars for temporal expressions (section 2.3.).
$TI 2.1. Temporal expressions
$  Temporal expressions are:$

$ - _tense_, a linguistic category which consists of
morphological forms
    of the verb (e.g. work_ed_, work_s_) or of auxiliary
verb forms in combination with certain
    morphological forms of the verb which I will call "periphrastic tenses"
(e.g. _has_ work_ed_, _is_ work_ing_; Spanish: _esta@'_ trabaj_ando_).$

$ - _time adverbials_, linguistic categories consisting of time
     adverbs, prepositional phrases, nominal phrases
or time conjunction phrases (temporal adverbial clauses)
 (e.g. _for 3 years_, _3 jaar_, _gisteren_, _nadat_
....).$
$TI 2.2. The time model
$ I will assume that all temporal expressions have a function in relating
the event described by a sentence or a clause to a time model. For
present purposes a simplified specification of the features of the
model I assume suffices. (For definitions see e.g. Bruce (1972) or
Lisette(42))$

$ This _time model T_ is a partially ordered set of which the elements are
called time points. The ordering
relation is "_<_", meaning "earlier than". For this model we define
a notion _interval_.  Intervals are subsets of T without any gaps or
branches.$
$ One of those points is called _S_, the moment of speech or
narration.$
$ The 'objects' to be located in T will be called _events_. An event is 
something that can be located in time, dependent on the temporal ingredients
of the sentence that refers to the event. For example
in order to establish the
truth value of _John has been living here for 20 years_, we need to locate the
event 'John's living here' in T.$
$ An event  is assumed to correspond to an 
interval _E_ of T. We will say that the event is located in T when the relation
between E and S can be established.
This relation can be complex in the sense that more intervals than E and S
can be involved. Such intervals are called _reference intervals_.$

$ Intervals can be characterized by _properties_ indicating e.g. the
'length' or 'duration' of an interval, a particular relation to S or a part of
the calendar. These properties are expressed by adverbials or special
(auxiliary) verbs.$
$ The event which corresponds to the interval E has temporal properties which
are often called
"_Aktionsart_" in the literature. Both the main verb and its arguments of the
clause which expresses the event
may play a role in the
determination of the Aktionsart (cf. Verkuyl (1972)).$
$ Usually four types of Aktionsart
are distinguished (cf. e.g. De Vuyst (1983)) as
is illustrated in the following examples:$

     (19  This book belong to me (_stative_)
     (20) John work (_activity_)
     (21) John write a letter (_accomplishment_)
     (22) The bom explode (_achievement_)

$ The event in (19) is durative; it can take place at an arbitrarily
long interval (test: at 3 o'clock (= point), for many years (long interval),
*in 3 hours (`total result')).$
$ In (20) the event is durative, but it cannot be claimed to take place only at
a time point (i.e. a minimal interval)
in the model; it is dynamic which implies
some progress or change (test: *at 3 o'clock, for many years, *in 3 hours).$
$ The event in (21) is terminative, because the result or end is
indicated; it can be looked at from the "outside" as a unit, but
it cannot be claimed to take place at a time point in the model;
it is dynamic when looked at from the "inside"
(activity) (test: *at 3 o'clock, in 3 hours, *for many years).$
$ In (22) the event is terminative, because the end or
result is indicated but it is also claimed to take place at a
time point in the model and therefore also called momentary (test: at 3 
o'clock, *for many years, *in 3 hours).$

$ There are two important types of relations between intervals:$
$ 1) the _deictic_ relation: relation between a reference interval and S$
$ 2) the _aspectual_ relation: relation between E and a reference interval$
$ These relations are expressed by morphological and periphrastic tense.$
$TI 2.3. Time in Rosetta
$ For defining the translation of temporal expressions in the Rosetta framework
we have to write isomorphic
compositional grammars for them, which
boils down to:$
$ a) specifying for each language:$
$ (i) temporal expressions (time adverbials etc.)
expressing properties of time intervals,$
$ (ii) syntactic rules (e.g. tense rules) that indicate how
temporal expressions must and
can be combined, expressing relations between those intervals,$
$ b) attuning these expressions and rules of the languages involved to each
other.$

$ I will now discuss the
motives for the strategy followed in these grammars and for the particular
choice of reference intervals in the time model.$

$ 1. Tenses and adverbials cannot be treated independently:$

$ - Not all combinations of tenses and adverbials are correct:$

    (23) * Gisteren zal hij werken
    (24) * He will be working yesterday

$ Rules that introduce tenses and/or time adverbials must have conditions with
respect to each other.$
 
$ - Sometimes the translation of a tense is only correct if it occurs with a
certain time adverbial. Consider for example the pair (25)/(26):$

     (25) Jan werk_t_ hier _al 3 jaar_ (Pres. Tense)
     (26) John _has been_ work_ing_ here _for 3 years_
                           (Pres. Perf. Prog. Tense)

$ The corresponding tense of the Dutch Present Tense in the context of the
time adverbial _al 3 jaar_ in (25), is in English
a Present Perfect Progressive Tense as
in (26). But without that time adverbial the translation is different as is
shown in the examples$
$ (27) - (29):$

     (27) Jan werk_t_ (Pres. Tense)
     (28) John _is_ work_ing_ (Pres. Prog. Tense)
     (29) *John _has been_ work_ing_ (Pres. Perf. Prog. Tense)

$ - Sometimes the translation of a tense is only correct if the clause or
sentence is "in the scope of a certain time adverbial in the preceding
context":$

     (30) Jan loopt ook
     (31) John will walk too

$ (31) is a correct translation of (30) in a future context, i.e. in the
preceding text some future time adverbial must have occured.$

$ - Adverbials are not always translated into adverbials. Consider for example
the pair (32)/(33):$

     (32) English: He has _just_ arrived.
     (33) Spanish: El _acaba de_ llegar.

$ In (32) the adverb _just_ expresses the "near past", but in (33) a special
verb _acabar de_ which could be considered as a part of some perifrastic tense
is used.$
$ These examples are an indication that the grammars for temporal expresions
should take into account tenses and time adverbials together.$

$ 2.
Van Eynde et al. (1985) give a specification of time meaning representation
for
machine translation, based on a time model with three intervals, E, R and S,
which results in time meaning representations that do take into account time
adverbials. A time meaning representation has the general scheme:$

  p  S,R,E  time (Rel%1%(R,S) and Pred%1%(R) and Rel%2%(E,R) and
                  Pred%2%(E) and AT(E,p))

$ where _time_ is the set of time points, _AT_ a relation that relates a
proposition p to an interval E, Rel%1% the deictic relation, Pred%1% a
predicate represented by a when-adverbial specifying R, Rel%2% the aspectual
relation and Pred%2% a predicate represented by a duration adverbial
specifying E.$
$ Although they do not propose it explicitly, it is possible to
achieve this time meaning representation compositionally by subsequent
function application.$

$ In their time model, however, the set of aspectual relations, relations
between E and R, contains next to the _retrospective_ relation
(E _before_ R) the
_imperfective_ relation (E _contains_ R). This seems inadequate in view of
sentences that can have both
an
imperfective and a retrospective aspectual relation as in  e.g. (25) and (26).$
$ The complexity of the aspectual relation is also recognized in Maegaard
(1982) where a special value _CONTINUOUS_ for the attribute
_RETROSPECTVE_ was introduced for the translation of verbal tenses.$
$ 
Krauwer and Des Tombe (1985) make similar observations.$

$ I propose therefore that in the Rosetta framework$
$ 1) a time meaning
representation obligatorily will contain an aspectual relation, i.e. a relation
between E and a reference interval R%E%, which will be called _perfective_
if E is a subset of R%E% and
_imperfective_ if R%E% is a subset of E&1&, and$
$ 2) that it can optionally contain a retrospective relation between R%E%
and  a time point R%S%, which is
some "local point of evaluation"&2&, meaning that R%E%
lasts _until_ R%S%.$ 
$ This R%S% is an arbitrary point of some reference interval. Consider
for example:$

     (34) Yesterday John had been living there for 3 years

$ The _3 years_ (R%E%) last until some point during _yesterday_
(R%S%).$

$ If there is no retrospective relation, R%S% will be an arbitrary point of
R%E%.$ 
$ Between R%S% and S  the _deictic relation_ is specified: _Past_ (R%S% is
_before_ S), _Present_ ( R%S% is _simultaneous with_ S) or _Future_ (R%S% is
_after_ S).$

$ So a time meaning representation of an event in Rosetta will consist of:$
$ - properties of E, R%E% and R%S%$
$ - an aspectual relation between E and R%E%$
$ - optionally a retrospective relation between R%E% and R%S%$
$ - a deictic relation between R%S% and S$

$ In the next section compositional
grammars for temporal expressions will be proposed which
start with a clause and apply rules that will first specify
the properties for E, then the aspectual relation and the properties for R%E%,
then optionally the retrospective relation and properties of R%S%, and
finally the deictic relation.$
$ Note that a possible _prospective_ relation, expressed for example in  a 
sentence as _hij woont hier nog drie jaar_, is not taken into account here.$
$NP
$TI 3. Isomorphic grammars for temporal expressions
$TI 3.1. Global specification
$ The goal of the grammars for temporal expressions is to specify all forms
that express some aspect of time in a clause.$
$ Semantically,
properties of and relations between time intervals and the event
are specified.$
$ I will discuss the grammars from a generative point of view only.$

_Import_
$ The rules of these grammars are applied
to a clause which consists of a verb, its arguments and an attribute
Aktionsart, the value of which must
have been specified during the composition of the
clause. Other temporal attributes have unmarked values.$

_Export_
$ The result of the application of
the rules is a clause with specified tense forms, temporal
auxiliaries and adverbials.$

_Other import_
$ The rules have one argument, a clause,
or two arguments, a clause and another temporal expression, e.g. an
adverbial or an auxiliary verb, that we wish to introduce
categorematically. They are the export from other subgrammars and must have
a _corresponding_ expression in all other languages of the system. This
corresponding expression need not to be of the same (syntactic) category.
This is only possible on the condition that the subgrammars that yield the
corresponding expressions of different categories are isomorphic (see Carel en
Lisette (67)).$

_Rule classes_
$ To achieve isomorphy of the
grammars for temporal expressions, _corresponding_ rules
for the languages of the system have to be written.$
$ I will distinguish five classes of rules. The rules are either
obligatory (OB),
meaning that exactly one of this class of rules is applied, or optional (OP).$

$ I. Aktionsart rules (OP): the application of these rules results in a new
clause with a different Aktionsart value caused by some (auxiliary) verb or
adverbial that is inserted into the clause.$

$ II. duration rules (OP): These rules insert a duration adverbial into the
clause.$

$ III. aspect rules (OB): These rules insert a reference adverbial and specify
the aspectual tense forms (perfective or imperfective) of the verbs.$

$ IV. retrospective rules (OP): These rules are applied to a clause that
contains some retrospective reference adverbial. They insert another,
non-retrospective reference adverbial and add, if necessary, auxiliary
verbs and/or adverbials.$

$ V. deictic rules (OB): These rules determine the deictic tense form of the
verbs in the clause.$

$ In 3.3. the rules will be discussed in more detail.$

_Transformations_
$ Transformations for the order of the constituents
and deletion of abstract temporal adverbials
will be assumed
in the grammars.$
 
_Control_
$ The
rules will presumably be applied in the order I to V (from a generative,
compositional point of view).$

$TI 3.2. The S-trees
$TI 3.2.1. The S-tree for clause
$ A clause is represented as an
S-tree with a top node CL that, for the time being,
has the following temporal attributes and
corresponding value sets in all languages:$
Aktionsart: {stative, activity, accomplishment, achievement}
aspect: {imperfective, perfective, unmarked}
deixis: {present, past, future, unmarked}
retrospectivity: {-retro, +retro}
$ The _import_ S-tree has  values from the following value sets:$
Aktionsart: {stative, activity, accomplishment, achievement}
aspect: {unmarked}
deixis: {unmarked}
retrospectivity: {-retro}
$ The _export_ S-tree has  values from the following value sets:$
Aktionsart: {stative, activity, accomplishment, achievement}
aspect: {perfective, imperfective}
deixis: {present, past, future}
retrospectivity: {-retro, +retro}
$ A clause contains a VERB node
with attribute-value pairs concerning the verb form,
which may differ over languages and an inherent attribute that plays a role
in the determination of the
Aktionsart:$
(I chose English names - as far as possible - for all attributes and values for
readability, efficiency and copying reasons)

class: {stative, movement, durative, momentary}

English: modus: {_infinitive_, indicative, ingform, participle}
         tense: {_unmarked_, present, past}

Dutch: modus: {_infinitive_, indicative, subjunctive, imperative, participle,
               presparticiple}
       tense: {_unmarked_, present, past}

Spanish: modus {_infinitive_, indicative, subjuntive, imperative, gerundio,
                participle, presparticiple}
         aspect: {_unmarked_, perfective, imperfective}
         tense: {_unmarked_, present, past}
         future: {_-future_, +future}

$ The underlined value is the value in the import S-tree.$
$ The export S-tree has a value from these sets.
Note that these attributes and their values differ from those in
Rosetta2 in some languages (see further section 9).$

$ Semantically, a clause represents an event associated with a time interval E.$
$TI 3.2.2. The S-trees for temporal adverbials
$ The
temporal adverbials may be of various categories:
e.g. ADVP, PP, NP or CONJP (a time conjunction with e.g. a clause).$
$ They are marked at the topnode for temporal properties by the
following attributes (for convenience, I will assume the names of attributes
and values the same for all languages, although is not strictly necessary):$
$RL 4
class: {duration, reference}
deixis: {present, past, future, unmarked}
aspect: {perfective, imperfective, unmarked}
retrospectivity: {+retro, -retro}

$ - Adverbials of the _duration_
class will always have the value _unmarked_ for
their deixis and _-retro_ for their retrospectivity attribute.
They indicate a property of the interval E.
Perfective duration adverbials specify the duration of the event (`the interval 
is a subset of the event'), imperfective
the duration of an interval during which the event takes place (` the event is 
a subset of the interval'). For example:$

$RL 4
     PP{class: duration, aspect: imperfective,
        deixis: unmarked, retrospectivity: -retro}
        (in three hours)
        Note: Dutch: _in_, not _over_

$ - _Reference_ adverbials indicate properties of intervals R. If their deixis
attribute has the value _unmarked_, they are called _absolute_,
indicating that there are no restrictions on the relations of the interval with
S, otherwise they
are called _deictic_, indicating that the interval has a certain relation with
S. If their retrospective attribute has the value _+retro_,
they are called _retrospective_, indicating that the interval has the relation
_until_ to the reference point R%S%. For example:$

$RL 3
     ADVP{class: reference, aspect: imperfective,
          deixis: past, retrospectivity: -retro}
          (yesterday)
$TI 3.2.3. The S-trees for abstract adverbials
$ Clauses do not always contain explicit
adverbials:$
$ a) In case of _isolated clauses_ without reference adverbials we will assume
an abstract deictic reference adverbial which indicates
the moment of speech S:$

$RL 3
     ADV{class: reference; deixis: present;
         aspect: perfective; retrospectivity: -retro;
         key: REF}()

$ In general, clauses or sentences occur in _texts_ and reference
adverbials can have scope over subsequent clauses. For those latter clauses
we will assume that they
have abstract anaphoric reference adverbials with the properties
of their antecedents; they will probably resemble abstract adverbials.$

$ b) In case a reference interval is indicated that has the property
that it ranges over the whole time axis until some reference point R%S%,
we assume an abstract adverbial:$

$RL 3
$TI 3.2.4.Implications in other subgrammars and the dictionary
$TI 3.2.4.1. Time adverbials
$ In temporal subgrammars values are assigned to attributes of the VERB
and the CLAUSE. All other import S-trees are assumed to have temporal attributes
that have already been assigned
some value. These values must have been assigned
during the composition of these expressions, i.e. in other subgrammars.$
$ I assume that this will be the case in the following subgrammars (or their
equivalents in the forthcoming proposal by the isogroup):
ADVP, PP, NP and CONJP$
$ The attribute and value names are language-specific, of course, and can
be different, but for convenience I
consider them here the same for all languages.$
$ The export S-tree of these subgrammars will only have such specified values
if it contains a basic S-tree that has temporal properties. These properties
"percolate" in a certain way to a new topnode when it is composed by the
subgrammar.
I suppose that these percolation
rules are transformations or parts of "meaningful rules", because they are not
"translation relevant" rules themselves;
the corresponding basic S-trees should have the same
temporal properties. This means that every basic expression that can be the
lexical head of such a subgrammar must have temporal attributes. However, most
of the
time they will be assigned default values.$
$ The basic S-trees must have the following attributes and value sets
with respect to time (the
default values are underlined):$

class: {_unmarked_, durative, reference}
deixis: {_unmarked_, present, past, future}
aspect: {_unmarked_, perfective, imperfective}
retrospectivity: {_unmarked_, -retro, +retro}

it is possible that a not-_unmarked_ value of a complement of X is assigned to

$ Note that an NP also can function as temporal expression of the
duration type as e.g. in _Jan heeft NP[drie uur] in de tuin gewerkt_.

$ In that case it should have, unlike the example for NP given
above, not-_unmarked_ values for _aspect_
and _retrospectivity_, namely _perfective_ and _-retro_ respectively. In fact,
I think that these NP temporal expressions are derived from in Dutch _NP lang_
and in English _for NP_, where the _lang_ and _for_ contribute the necessary
values. I think that we have in practice two options for this phenomenon:$
$ 1) We derive these NP expressions from _NP lang_ and _for NP_ respectively
by deleting at some place the _lang_ and the _for_ optionally per language.$
$ 2) There is a special rule in the NP subgrammar that accounts for the required
values and this NP cannot function as complement for PREP or ADV anymore.$
$ Option 1) would also easily
account for the fact that the _NP_ in Dutch often has to
be translated into _for NP_ in English and _durante NP_ in Spanish.
To achieve that with option 2) the
NP-subgrammar in Dutch with the special rule must be isomorphic with the
PP-subgrammar in English or Spanish,
or the NP-subgrammars in these languages
must have a special (probably optional)
rule to introduce _for_,
_durante_ and _lang_
syncategorematically in these cases.$
$ At this moment, I do not want to make a choice, because I think this is a
topic
that should be discussed in relation with other "Measure Phrases".$

$ Note that the percolation mechanism can also be applied to time conjunctions
(CONJ) that take a clause with specified temporal attributes as an argument
to form a time conjunction phrase (CONJP) and
which can function, at their turn, as reference
adverbials.$

$RL 5
_Example_

$RL 3
     CONJ{class: reference, deixis: past
          aspect: unmarked, retrospectivity: unmarked,
          key: TOEN} (toen)

$RL 4
     CONJP{class: reference, deixis: past,
           aspect: imperfective, retrospectivity: -retro}
           (toen hij in de tuin werkte)
  (* the _aspect_ and _retrospectivity_ value come from the clause *)

$ This is a preliminary proposal and further research is needed.(see also
section 7.4.1.)$
$TI 3.2.4.2. Aktionsart
$ There is one other temporal attribute that is assumed to have already a value
assigned before the rules of the temporal subgrammars will be applied: the
attribute _Aktionsart_ of the clause. This assignment is assumed to be done
during the composition of the clause from the verb and its arguments, i.e. in
some subgrammar preceding the temporal subgrammar. I will call the
transformations that assign this value, _Aktionsartcalculation rules_.
(For isomorphy reasons, this will also be necessary for other XPPROPs!)$

$ It is a well-known fact that the Aktionsart value of the clause does not only
depend on
the verb and that it is very difficult to determine the right value,
as is illustrated by the examples (35) to (47) by applying some intuitive
criteria that can be derived from the "definitions" in section 2.2.. The rather 
sloppy combination tests with adverbials were:$
$ achievement: at 3 o'clock, *in 3 hours, *for many years$
$ accomplishment: *at 3 o'clock, in 3 hours, *for many years$
$ activity: *at 3 o'clock, *in 3 hours, for many years$
$ stative: at 3 o'clock, *in 3 hours, for many years$
$ (Note that Aktionsart is a property of a _tenseless_ clause)$

      (35) Elly at. (activity)
      (36) Elly at een appel. (accomplishment)
      (37) Elly at appels. (activity? accomplishment? stative?)
      (38) Elly was appels/een appel aan het eten. (activity?, stative?)
      (39) Elly at altijd appels. (activity)
      (40) Herman stierf. (achievement)
      (41) Herman lag op sterven. (stative) 
      (42) Huib behaalde het/een diploma. (achievement)
      (43) Huib behaalde alle diploma's. (achievement? accomplishment? stative?)
      (44) Huib behaalde diploma's. (activity? achievement? accomplishment?)
      (45) Wim sliep. (activity)
      (46) Wim zat te slapen. (stative? activity?)
      (47) Joep was blij. (stative)

$ We can observe in these examples that in cases where the value _stative_
rather clearly can be
assigned, there is always some verb present that could be classified as
"stative" or "local": _zijn_, _zitten_, _liggen_. Note that these examples
are all translated in English by _be_ and in Spanish by _ser_ or _estar_.
The other verbs are "dynamic" and either "durative" or "momentary": _eten_
and _slapen_ are "durative", _sterven_ and _behalen_ are "momentary". If they
are transitive, i.e. they
must or can have an object argument, it is possible, that
that object argument has influence on the resulting Aktionsart of the clause.
For "durative" verbs the Aktionsart
would be naturally, i.e. without arguments, _activity_
and for "momentary" _achievement_. Semantic properties of the object, such as
number, mass/countness,
definiteness, play a role in the kind of influence it has:$

_eten_ and _drinken_ are "durative", _winnen_ is "momentary"

          b.         de appel (accomplishment)

          d.           weddenschappen (activity, stative?)
     (52) a. Carel won drop (achievement, activity, stative?)
          b.           de drop (achievement)

     (53) a. Carel won een dropje (achievement)
          b.           het dropje (achievement)
          c.           de dropjes (achievement, accomplishment?)
          d.           dropjes (activity, stative?)

$ The unspecified amount or quantity
of the object in  the a.-examples of (49) and (52) and
the d.-examples of (48), (50), (51)
and (53) gives the impression of a durative, iterative event which results in
an _activity_ or _"stative"_ Aktionsart. But _stative_ in some "habitual" or
"dispositional" interpretation. In this interpretation it can be paraphrased
by "is an apple-eater" e.g., etc.
The _stative_ Aktionsart of _aan het V zijn_ has
an "actual" and may be more "temporary" interpretation, just as its translation
equivalents _be + ing-form_ and _estar + gerundio_. The copula verb _zijn_
which also has Aktionsart _stative_ can have both interpretations just like its
English translation _be_. Spanish has two copula verbs: _ser_ for the
"dispositional" interpretation and _estar_ for the "actual" interpretation.$

$ Until now we divided the dynamic verbs in two classes: the momentary verbs
(representing events with inherent termination) and the durative verbs
(representing events with possible termination). There is another class of
dynamic verbs that was not mentioned yet: the "movement" verb, a class of
(durative) verbs that represent events that can be seen as terminated, i.e.
represent accomplishment events, but only by taking 1) a specified object if it
is a transitive verb and 2) an argument that indicates a specified "end
location" of the movement action in the form of a "directional phrase".$

Examples:
_transitive_

     (54) Gert duwde de kar (activity)
     (55) Gert duwde de kar naar de schuur (accomplishment)
     (56) Gert duwde karren naar de schuur (activity, stative?)

_ergative_

     (57) Eddy ging (activity)
     (58) Eddy ging naar Italie@" (accomplishment)
     (59) Eddy ging naar onbekende plaatsen (activity, stative?)

$ Another influence on the Aktionsart that was not taken into account is the
influence of the subject argument. In all examples a specified amount or
quantity of the subject was used. If we replace them by unspecified subjects
as e.g. "mensen", "men", "reizigers" in the examples (35)-(59),
the accomplishments
and achievements get another interpretation as activity (dispositional and
actual), but the accomplishment reading also remains if the subject is count,
probably because for every element of the "quantity of the subject" the "same
event" could hold. The same holds for achievements, because of the
"once"-reading momentary verbs always have.$

$RL 30
$ This results in the following scheme:$

VERB                    Realized arguments                    Aktionsart

stative                                                    --> stative



                   no object arg.                          --> activity

                   object arg.
                                  + spec. obj              --> accomplishment

                   no directional arg.                     --> activity

dynamic   movement 
                                   one arg. - spec.        --> activity
                   directional arg.
                                   + spec. dir. arg.       --> accomplishment

                   no object arg.                          --> achievement(once)
                                                           --> activity

          momentary
                                                           --> achievement(once)
                                    one arg. - spec        --> activity
                   object arg.
                                    + spec obj.            --> achievement

$ "Subject" and "object" here are the arguments before passive voice rules.$
$ I think that stative and activity Aktionsart
are "defaultly" dispositional and "made actual"
by aspect rules or a combination with _aan het V zijn_ and synonyms.$
$ The "- spec. objects" are the bare mass nouns plural count nouns and
"indefinite" nouns, but may
be other quantifiers  and generic arguments can have the same influence.$
$ Clauses with _activity_ or _accomplishment_ Aktionsart 
can be combined with _aan het V zijn_.$
$ It is possibile to look at achievements as lexical accomplishments that only
can have another Aktionsart if they have an - spec.  or no obj.$
$TI 3.3. The rules
$ I will now give an informal description of each type of rule containing
an account of syntactic and semantic aspects and the differences between Dutch,
English and Spanish.$

$ I. _Aktionsart rules_ (OP). They
change the
Aktionsart
and insert (complex) auxiliary verbs or adverbs, and/or determine the form of
the verb. Semantically, the event is modified.$
$ For example, an accomplishment event can be transformed into a
non-terminative event. Compare:$

     Eng: (60) CL (John write a letter) -->
               CL (John be writing a letter)
     Du:  (61) CL (Jan een brief schrijven) -->
               CL (Jan een brief aan het schrijven zijn)

$ This is sometimes called the "locative tense"; the rules insert:$
in Dutch: _aan het VERB_{verbform: Infinitief}_zijn_ (and synonyms:
          _te V zitten_, _te V liggen_ etc.)
in Spanish: _estar VERB_{verbform: gerundio}
in English: _be VERB_{verbform: ingform}
$ They change the Aktionsart value to _stative_ (due to the auxiliary),
but only with an actual interpretation.$

$ II. _duration rules_ (OP). These rules are
applied to an S-tree with a certain
Aktionsart value
and a duration adverbial with a certain aspect value that is inserted into the
clause. The aspect value of the clause
can now be turned into _perfective_.$
$ This rule applies the property denoted by the adverbial, to the interval E.$
$ For example:$

     (62) CL (John write _for three hours_)

$ III. _aspect rules_ (OB). Rules with two arguments:
1) a clause with a certain Aktionsart and aspect 
and 2) a (possibly
anaphoric) reference adverbial with a certain aspect. They
determine the imperfective and
perfective verb forms, sometimes with auxiliaries.
The aspectual verb forms can
differ over languages. English seems to have perfective simple tense forms;
the imperfective forms are composed with the auxiliary _be_ (a periphrastic
tense), except for stative verbs.
Spanish has clear imperfective and perfective past tense forms.
In Dutch the verb form does not seem to distinguish between imperfective and
perfective. In cases where perfective and imperfective forms are not
distinguished ambiguities will result.$
$ These rules will rule out some possible combinations of Aktionsart and aspect
of the involved elements.$
$ The aspect
value of the clause _unmarked_ has to be changed into _perfective_ or
_imperfective_. The reference adverbial is inserted
into
the S-tree.$
$ Semantically,
the property denoted by the adverbial is applied to the interval
R%E% and the relation between the intervals E and R%E% is expressed.$

$RL 5
Example:
     (63) CL (Ayer Juan leyo@' un libro.) (perfective)
              (Yesterday-John-read-a-book)
     (64) CL (Ayer Juan lei@'a un libro.) (imperfective)
              (Yesterday-John-was-reading-a-book) 

$ IV. _retrospectivity rules_ (OP). Rules that have two arguments: 1) a clause
with a
certain
aspect and a reference adverbial that has the retrospectivity value
_+retro_ (this may be PAST), and 2) a (possibly anaphoric)
reference adverbial that has the retrospectivity value _-retro_.
They insert auxiliary verbs such as _have_ (_hebben_/_zijn_ (Dutch),
 _haber_
(Spanish)), if necessary. In English _have_ must always be inserted. In Dutch
and Spanish it is obligatory if the aspect value is _perfective_. So these
languages have two rules: one for perfective and one for imperfective clauses.
The reference adverbial is inserted into the S-tree.$
$ The rules that insert _have just_ (English) _zojuist hebben/zijn_ (Dutch)
and _acabar de_ (Spanish), under the condition that the clause contains the
abstract adverbial PAST and the aspect value _perfective_, to express
near-retrospectivity, belong to this class. (It seems also possible to me to
let _just_, _zojuist_ and _acabar de_ function as the retrospective adverbial
that is introduced categorematically instead of PAST.)$
$ Semantically, these rules apply the property denoted by the adverbial to 
R%S% and
express the relation _until_ or _"near-until"_ of R%E%
(indicated by the retrospective adverbial) to R%S%.$

$RL 4
Example:
     (65) CL (REF John have just read this book PAST.)
     (66) CL (REF Juan acabar de leer este libro PAST.)
     (67) CL (REF Jan dit boek PAST zojuist gelezen hebben)

$ V. _deictic rules_ (OB). These rules are applied to a clause with a reference
adverbial
(that can be anaphoric), inserted by rules of type III or IV.
They
determine
present, past and future forms of the verbs, sometimes with insertion
of an auxiliary verb form, for example _will_ for future in English, after
checking if
the deictic value of the reference
adverbial is compatible.$
$ Semantically, the relation between R%S% (a subset of the interval indicated by
the reference adverbial in the clause) and S is expressed. The deictic
relations are: _present_ (R%S% is simultaneous with S), _past_ (R%S% is before
S) and _future_ (R%S% is after S).$
$ It is possible that some languages (e.g. Dutch)
have complex deictic rules that
indicate
for example a "past event with present relevance". This is similar to a
"present with retrospective PAST", but differs in that the
interval R%E% is not _until_, but _before_ R%S%.
At the moment I will
ignore the "extra meaning" and treat them with a deictic past rule,
because this phenomenon seems to have to do with more pragmatic
factors such
as "distance with respect to the event from the speaker's viewpoint"
or knowledge of the world like the present existence of persons or objects.$

$RL 4
Example:
     (68) John read a book yesterday
     (69) *John has read a book yesterday
     (70) John had read a book yesterday

$ Note that these rules allow adverbials to be translated into "tenses" and
take into account the relation between tenses and adverbials by checking every
time the appropriateness of combinations of properties of intervals and the
relations between those intervals.$
$TI 3.4. Transformations
$ This proposal assumes some transformations:$
$ 1) percolation transformations in subgrammars for ADVP, PP, NP (and CONJP).$
$ 2) calculation of the Aktionsart attribute value.$
$ 3) the determination of finite or infinite form of the verb
$ 4) in Dutch: the second place for the finite verb$
$ 5) deletion of the abstract adverbials$

$ The
place of these transformations in the control expression must be defined in
consultation with other proposals for subgrammars (see also section 6).$
$TI 3.5. Control
$ There are two obligatory rule classes that must be applied in the following
order: aspect - deixis. I suppose, for the time being, that the other
-optional- rule classes will fit in as follows:$
$ [Aktionsart] . [duration] . aspect . [retrospective] . deixis$
$ Note that this order of rule class application also gives a rather natural
syntactic order of the inserted constituents: they are always added "at the
outside" (assuming a certain underlying order, e.g. SOV or SVO).$
$ The best place of the transformations 4) and 5) is in any case after
the deixis rules in the derivation, 3) before the deixis rules and 2) before
the Aktionsart rules.$
$NP
$TI 4. Examples
$ In this section
I will give some examples of parallel derivations of sentences with
temporal expressions that are translation equivalents. I will leave out
irrelevant specification of nodes.$

$ Figure 1 contains the isomorphic

Dutch translation equivalent:$

$RL 2
     (72) Jan schrijft al 2 uur
          (Dutch: John-writes-already-2-hours)

$ The Dutch rules differ from the English ones in that  R'%1% does
not insert an auxiliary for the imperfective form as in English. It results in:
_Jan al 2 uur schrijven_. R'%2% differs from R%2% also with respect to the
introduction of the auxiliary verb. In Dutch it is not necessary to insert
_hebben/zijn_ if the clause has imperfective aspect. R'%2% results in:
_Jan REF al 2 uur schrijven_. R'%3% is like R%3%, but in finite clauses the
last verb is placed in second position in Dutch: _Jan schrijft al 2 uur_.$

$ (72) is only one of the possible translations of (71): (71)
is ambiguous.
The _be
writing_ can also be due to some "Aktionsart rule" (R%4%)
corresponding to _aan het
schrijven zijn_ (R'%4%). The other Dutch translation is:$

$ But _for 2 hours_
is ambiguous too and
can also be a perfective duration adverbial corresponding to the Dutch _2 uur_.
The duration rules (R%5% and R'%5%) insert them. The clause will now have
perfective aspect and the retrospective adverbial PAST will be introduced by
the perfective aspect rule (R%6% and R'%6%). In Dutch the
retrospective rule R'%7% (different from R'%2% but also corresponding
to the English R%2%) is now
applied:
the one for a clause with perfective aspect that
inserts the auxiliary _hebben/zijn_. The resulting Dutch translation

$ The conditions in the rules filter out certain unacceptable
combinations, e.g.:$

$RL 2
     (75) *John died for a while
     (76) *John was working in three hours

$ (75)
is ruled out because _for a while_ is a perfective duration adverbial that
cannot combine with achievements or accomplishments and (76) because _in three
hours_ is an imperfective duration adverbial that cannot combine with
activities and statives.$

$ Note that this isomorphic approach results in a systematic ambiguity of
Dutch tense forms with respect to other languages, because Dutch has no
perfective/imperfective tense forms. This illustrated by the examples
(77)-(79).$

$TI 5. Habitual aspect
$ The proposal presented in section 3 did not say anything about "habitual
aspect", but as this notion will play a role in the next section in connection
with isomorphy of subgrammars, I will take into account this kind of aspect
first.$

$ Consider the following sentences:$

     (80) Andre@' schaakt
     (81) Andre@' speelt viool

$ These sentences express activity events that have two interpretations:$
$ 1) an "actual"$
$ 2) a "dispositional"$
$ The first is expressing that he is doing it now and the second that it is
a "habit" or "property" of him, not implying that he is doing it right now.
The crucial fact for the dispositional reading is that  the event is not
"anchored" on the time-axis, but the "habit of that event" in the same way as
stative events that express properties, emotions and other states. These
stative events do not
take part in the imperfective/perfective distinction. If they are meant to be
actual the perfective aspect as expression of being the subset of a reference
interval is used.$

example:

    (82) Andre@' plays chess (dispositional)
    (83) Andre@' is playing chess (actual, imperfective)
    (84) Andre@' plays chess (actual, perfective, reported speech)

$ The dispositional sentences have a "generic" character and we add to the class
of aspect rules the _habitual aspect rule_. In English this rule assigns a
perfective tense form (simple tense), in Spanish an imperfective (imperfecto in
the past) and in Dutch an "onvoltooide tijd". This rule also inserts a reference
adverbial but not all adverbials are allowed. For example, specific deictic 
adverbials such as _tomorrow_, and _yesterday_ are excluded.
This rule will be the most "neutral" aspect rule and also act
as the "default rule" for the aspect rule class. The value _habitual_ has to be
added to the value set of the aspect attribute. Clauses with this aspect value
cannot be input to the retrospectivity rules as these rules have an "actual
character".$
$NP
$TI 6. Incorporation of the temporal grammars in the iso-scheme
$ This section is based on a preliminary iso-scheme as is presented in
Jan O.(93)
and (107) and discussions with the iso-group.$
$ I will indicate how the proposal presented above can be adapted to be
incorporated into the iso-scheme in principle
(section 6.1.), and make some remarks about
necessary additions in view of this scheme (section 6.2.).
In section 7 then a preliminary proposal
for the treatment of time in subclauses (complement, relative and adverbial
clauses)
will be given.$
$TI 6.1. Adaptations
_Scope of time adverbials_
$ To represent the scope of adverbials correctly in the derivation tree, the
iso-group suggested to introduce abstract prepositions that take a VAR for which
the adverbial can be substituted.$
$ This means with respect to the temporal grammars of section 3 that the rules
that introduced adverbials (Duration rules, Aspect rules and Retrospectivity
rules) should not insert the adverbials directly, but check if the VARs of
the abstract prepositions have the correct properties (assuming a pre-action).
This presupposes that
these VARs have the attributes and values that have the adverbials of section
3.  There are two possibilities for the abstract prepositions:$
1) one abstract preposition for time: PREP {key: TIME}
2) three abstract prepositions:
        for duration: PREP {key: DUR}
        for reference (non-retrospective): PREP {key: REF}
        for reference (retrospective): PREP {key: RETRO}
$ The substitution for the VAR can now take place together with the other
substitution rules (nowhsubstitution and whsubstitution).$

_Temporal grammars in the scheme_

$ Roughly, the
temporal grammars substitute the RC Clauseformation in earlier schemes.$
$ Clauseformation is a member of the subgrammar VERBPPROPtoCLAUSE and ordered
after propositionsubstitution and before the TC PROPOKrules. It was meant to
handle "tense' and "aspect", "imperative", the passive auxiliary, finite- and
infiniteness and do-insertion. Except for
the do-insertion this was what the time
rules of Rosetta2 did. I propose the
following scheme:$

VERBPPROPformation:

TC: Aktionsartcalculation

VERBPPROPtoCLAUSE:

TC : Aktionsartcalculation
{RC: Aktionsartrules}
[RC: durationrules]
RC: aspectrules
[RC: retrospectivityrules]
TC: finitenessrules
RC: deixisrules
TC: abstractadverbialdeletion

$ _Aktionsartcalculation_: calculates the value of the attribute Aktionsart 
according to the directives in section 3.2.4.2..
There should be already a "basic" Aktionsart calculation rule in the VERBPPROP
formation grammar ordered before the passive rule (see section 3.2.4.2.).
In the VERBPPROPtoCLAUSE
subgrammar it is ordered after
propositionsubstitution, so that if there are any changes because of that
substitution it can be taken into account.$
$ _Aktionsartrules_: these rules can change the value of the Aktionsart
attribute because of the insertion of some "auxiliary" verb or adverb, but
may be it is better to handle these verbs and adverbs categorematically and
introduce them in the clause via propositionsubstitution just like _graag_ or
the English modal auxiliaries (see below).$
$ _Durationrules_: these rules are now reduced to checking the presence of
a VAR and if it has the
correct values for its attributes.$
$ _Aspectrules_: these rules remain the the same as in section 3.3. except for
the insertion of reference adverbials: now only the presence and the 
values of the VAR are
checked.$
$ _Retrospectivityrules_: these rules remain the same except for the insertion
of the reference adverbial just as in the aspectrules.$
$ _Finitenessrules_: these transformations give the clause a finite or infinite
value and the verb a finite or infinite form. In English, the auxiliary _do_
is inserted in the finite clause if no other auxiliaries are inserted in the
previous rules (_be_, _have_ or _modals_). _Do_ is deleted in certain cases
(not negative, not questionmood) at the end of the derivation. For infinite
clause there are often more forms: _+_ _te_ infinitief, _+_ _to_ infinitive,
ingform. Most of the time finite and infinite transformations will be both
applicable
because at this point in the derivation it is not yet known what kind of clause
it will be. Main clauses will always be finite, but complement or relative
clauses (subclauses)
can be finite or infinite; which one it has to be may depend on the
matrix clause or the kind of subclause (see also section 7). At this point
temporary paraphrases (also called temporary ambiguities) are created.$
$ _Deixisrules_: these rules remain the same as in section 3. There are deixis
rules for finite and infinite clauses. In the infinite clauses the verb
attribute deixis remains unmarked.$
$ _Abstractadverbialdeletionrules_: Abstract adverbials have to be deleted
somewhere if they are present.$
$TI 6.2. Remarks
_Infinite clauses "without aspect and deixis"_
$ Until now every clause (finite or infinite) has his own "time", but may be
there are clauses that do not have their own time specification; the time is
completely dependent on the time of another clause. Candidates for such clauses
are infinite subclauses and candidates for matrixclauses that take such
subclauses as their complement are semi-auxiliaries as _like_ and certain
adverbials as _graag_.$
$ If a clause does not have own time, that implies that it cannot have own
reference time adverbials, i.e. different from the ones in the higher clause.
Duration adverbials seem to be allowed, probably because they specify
properties of the E-interval or of the event.$
$ This means that there must  be rules that 1) do not or defaultly assign aspect
and deixis
values or 2) aspect and deixis rules are not obligatory but also optional.$
$ I will give here as an example three possible solutions for
the _graag/like_-case.$

$ In the first solution this treatment
of the complement clause of _graag/like_ results to simplify the proposition
substitution rule for _graag_. I will assume in this solution optional aspect
and deixis rules.$

$ In the propositionrule for _graag_ it is not necessary anymore to assign a
value unmarked to a temporal
attribute that had already a not-unmarked value assigned
or to change all the temporal rules in such a way that they also take as input
a clause that has already that value assigned.$
$ Maybe such clauses also should not receive a mood value, but only a
category or attribute value to indicate the kind of clause.$
$ Note that the property of "having (no) time" is translation relevant in this
approach. If e.g. an infinite clause is translated into a finite clause with
own time, then it also should have own time! (see also section 7)$

$ A second solution to this problem is using instead of optional aspect rules
the habitual rule that was introduced in section 5. The aspect attribute is
 assigned the value _habitual_ in the aspect rule class. _Graag_ and _like_
have a condition for their argument that it must be habitual and infinite. In
Dutch this will be an _infinitive_ without _te_ and in English an _ingform_ and
in Spanish an _infinitive_(?). I think that it is better to choose in English
here the infinite _ingform_ because that reflects more the habitual reading of
_hij zwemt graag_. The aspect for _graag_ or _like_ can be habitual again, so
the aspect rules must accept clauses with habitual or unmarked aspect in Dutch
or in the proposition rule of _graag_ the value of the resulting clause must be
made "unmarked" again (what was avoided in solution 1). But maybe _habitual_ is
the unmarked aspect value.$

$ A third solution to this problem is using the option of head modification
proposed in Franciska (118). _Graag_ modifies _zwemmen_ before the VERPPROP
formation
rules in Dutch and _like_ _swimming_ in English. Note that _zwemmen_ has to
correspond to _swimming_ to get the best translation. This is not so strange if
we look at the nominal character of infinitives in Dutch, e.g. _het zwemmen_,
which has to be translated into _the swimming_ and not *_the swim_.$

Consider also:

     (85) I like working                1. ik werk graag
                                        2. ik houd van werken/werk

     (86) I like the work                  ik houd van het werk

$ Additional support for the habitual treatments of _graag/like_ is given by the
fact that sentences with _graag_ are odd with certain tenses just like other 
sentences with stative habitual or emotive verbs in an habitual interpretation:$

     (87) ? Ik heb graag gefietst
     (88) ? Ik heb fietsen gehaat
     (89) ? Ik heb fietsen saai gevonden
     (90) ? Ik heb plegen te fietsen

$ These sentences only have an interpretation if some retrospective
period is added: _altijd_ (i.e. tot nu toe), _nooit_ etc.. But then not the
"habit" is expressed but a perfective view of that habit, placed on 
the time-axis. All stative, emotive, habitual verbs (or "complex verbs", result
of head modification)
have this property of two aspects:$
1) habitual, dispositional
2) perfective, actual
$ With imperfective aspect they get an iterative or other interpretation,
compare e.g. _He is being ill (again)_$
$ Note that there are also emotive non-habitual verbs that can have all
aspects:$

     (91) I felt fine (dispositional)               estaba bien
     (92) I felt fine (perfective, actual)          estuve bien
     (93) I was feeling fine (imperfective, actual) estaba bien

$RL 3
_Finite clauses without aspect and/or deixis_
$ Candidates for finite clauses without aspect and deixis are imperative
clauses. They also do not receive values or default ones
for the deixis and aspect attributes
of clause and verb just as the infinite ones described above. The imperative
tense form is assigned in the imperative moodrule in the CLAUSEtoSENT grammar.
It is a finite clause, because it is a main sentence and because it is
submitted to Agreement and Verbsecond or Verbfirst in Dutch. The most important
characteristic is that it is a finite main clause with unmarked deixis value.$
$ Maybe finite subclauses that are submitted to the "consecutio temporum"-rule
should be counted to the class of finite clauses that have no own deictic time
(see section 7).$

_Isomorphic subgrammars_
$ In the case of "no-time"-rules the rule classes for aspect and deixis
are optional or have a "syntactically empty rule". The only left obligatory
class in the subgrammar VERBPPROPtoCLAUSE will then be the transformation
class: finiteness. The "no-time"-rules seem also to be necessary to let an
XPPROPtoCLAUSE grammar be isomorphic with an XPPROPtoXPPROP grammar, i.e. to
let correspond e.g. in Dutch
_ik vind [hem leuk]_ to _ik vind [dat hij leuk is]_.$
$ Whether a verb or adverb takes a complement clause with or/and without "own
time"
is a property of that verb or adverb.$
$ An example of a Dutch verb that maybe take both options is _haten_.$

     (94) Ik haat het om te roken/roken (without time)
     (95) I hate to smoke/smoking

     (96) Ik haat het dat ik rook (with time)
     (97) Ik haat het dat ik rookte (op die bewuste middag)
     (98) I hate it that I smoke
     (99) I hate it that I smoked

$ Note that the clauses "without time" come close to the NP's _roken_ and
_smoking_ (see also above).$

$ If we use instead of no-aspect rule the default (i.e. habitual) aspect rule,
the other subgrammrs also must have a rule that corresponds to the same
operation in the interlingua. For the ADJPPROP-, ADVPPROP- and NPPROPtoCLAUSE
grammars this can also be the habitual aspect rule applied to the verb that
is inserted; in the XPPROPtonoCLAUSE grammars it must be a rule that accounts
for "general character".$
$ [hij een leuke jongen] in [ik vind [hem een leuke jongen]] expresses the
"hij een leuke jongen is" in general.$

$ Instead of "no time"-rules for infinite clauses in the VERBPPROPtoCLAUSE
grammar we could also introduce the missing VERBPPROPtonoCLAUSE-grammar in the
scheme that would be isomorphic with the VERBPROPtoCLAUSE-grammar in the
sense that in the former only
exist default aspect rules and deictic rules depending
on the matrix clause analogous to ADJPPROPtonoCLAUSE and ADJPPROPtoCLAUSE.$

$ A choice between these options has to be made and depends on the answer
to the following question: Is "having no aspect and deixis" (as seems to be the
case in the XPPROPtonoCLAUSE cases) the same as
"having default (i.e. habitual) aspect and deixis dependent from the matrix
clause"?$

     (100) a. Ik haat het om te roken/roken
           b. Ik haat het dat ik rook (habitual + actual interpretation)

     (101) a. I hate to smoke/smoking
           b. I hate it that I smoke (habitual interpretation)
           c. I hate it that I am smoking (actual interpretation)

$ The a.-sentences have a general reading and do not necessarily
imply that I smoke.
The b.-sentences also can have general reading, but imply that I smoke.
The c.-sentence (and the Dutch b.-sentence too) has an actual reading and
is not a paraphrase of the a.-sentence. Because of the different implications
the a.- and b.-sentences cannot be paraphrases or translation equivalents.
But is this not always the case if infinite complement clauses are translated
into finite ones and vice versa? The infinite clause always has a certain
vagueness; one of its interpretations could be the finite one in general or
dispositional reading. Are these differences in implication translation
relevant distinctions or do we only have a preference for the one in the
source language? This boils down to the question: are the finiteness rules
"meaningful rules" or syntactic transformations?$
$ If we choose for the most flexible approach to translation, the finiteness
rules must be transformations.$
$ Consider in this context also the following examples:$

     (102 I want John to come            Ik wil dat Jan komt
                                         *Ik wil Jan te komen

     (103) I believe John to be a lier   Ik geloof dat Jan een leugenaar is
                                         *Ik geloof Jan een leugenaar te zijn

$TI 7. Relative, complement and adverbial clauses
$TI 7.1. Introduction to the problems
$ Although this document was meant to be
mainly dedicated to the treatment of temporal
expressions in main clauses in an earlier phase,
 I have to discuss some aspects of the treatment
of relative, complement and adverbial
clauses with respect to time as the iso-scheme claims to account for them and
the problems already mentioned in the previous section.
I elaborated the proposal of section 3 for subclauses, but not all problems
are solved, so some future research will be needed.$

$ In the first place, I think that most of what was proposed for temporal
expressions above can be used in relative, complement and adverbial clauses too.
The difficulty of the time meaning representation for these clauses seems to be
in the first place the
deictic relation:$
$ is it an _independent_ relation between R%S% and S or is
it _dependent_ from the one of the matrix clause?
$ or in terms of the previous section: do they have "own deictic time" or not?$
$ And in the second place, do they have aspect, which possibilities for
aspect exist and does the aspect value depend from the matrix clause?$
$ The problems concerning the deictic question can be illustrated by the
following examples:$
_Relatives_

     (104) Jan ziet de ezel die appels eet (dependent, independent?)
     (105) Jan zag de ezel die appels at (dependent, independent?)
     (106) Jan zag de ezel die appels eet (independent)
     (107) Jan ziet de ezel die appels at (independent)

     (108) Jan zag de appels etende ezel (dependent, independent)
     (109) Jan ziet de appels etende ezel (dependent, independent?)

_Complements_

      (110) Jan denkt dat hij werkt (dependent)
      (111) Jan dacht dat hij werkte (dependent)
      (112) Jan denkt dat hij werkte (independent)
      (113) Jan dacht dat hij werkt (independent; _Jan_, _hij_ not coreferential)
      (114) Jan denkt te werken (dependent)
      (115) Jan dacht te werken (dependent)
      (116) Jan denkt dat hij heeft gewerkt (dependent)
      (117) Jan dacht dat hij had gewerkt (dependent)
      (118) Jan denkt gewerkt te hebben (dependent)
      (119) Jan dacht gewerkt te hebben (dependent)

      (120) Het schijnt dat Jan boos is (dependent)
      (121) Het schijnt dat Jan boos is geweest (dependent, independent?)
      (122) Het schijnt dat Jan boos was (independent)
      (123) Het schijnt dat Jan boos was geweest (independent)
      (124) Jan schijnt boos te zijn (dependent)
      (125) Jan schijnt boos geweest te zijn (dependent?, independent?)

_Adverbials_

             _temporal_
       (126) Jan werkte toen Marietje binnenkwam (dependent)
       (127) Jan werkt, terwijl Marietje binnenkomt (dependent)
       (128) *Jan werkte, toen/terwijl Marietje binnenkomt
       (129) *Jan werkt, toen/terwijl Marietje binnenkwam

             _not temporal_
       (130) Jan werkte, omdat Marietje binnenkwam (dependent, independent?)
       (131) Jan werkt, omdat Marietje binnenkomt (dependent, independent?)
       (132) Jan werkte, omdat Marietje binnenkomt (independent)
       (133) Jan werkt, omdat Marietje binnenkwam (independent)

$ The aspectual question with respect to the kind of aspect
is, of course, important in the case of infinite
relative and complement clauses. The dependency of aspect plays a role in the
case of adverbial clauses as they can belong to the class of temporal adverbials
already treated in section 3.$
$ It is not yet clear to me at this moment how to account for all
aspects that are involved here. Many of the examples are ambiguous with
respect to deictic dependency or aspect.$
$ It is clear that it is an interesting topic, especially because of
the necessity to translate sometimes non-finite and finite clauses into
each other. That that is possible can be illustrated
by the fact that many of the examples presented
above can be considered to be paraphrases of each other in some reading.$

$ I will treat first the complement clauses (7.2.), then the relative
clauses (7.3.) and finally the adverbial clauses (7.4.), the temporal ones in
7.4.1. and the non-temporal ones in 7.4.2. In all these sections first the
deictic problems and then the aspectual problems (aspect and retrospectivity)
will be treated.$
$TI 7.2. Complement clauses
_Deixis_
$ For the time being, I propose that complement clauses are
either _temporally dependent_, meaning that they are in the scope of the
deixis rule of the matrix clause (they do not have "own deictic time", they
cannot have own _deictic_ adverbials, differing from the ones of the
matrix-clause),
or _temporally independent_, meaning that
they are not in the scope of the deixis rule of the matrix clause (they have
"own deictic time"). This could
for example mean$
$ 1) that the substitution of the complement clause
precedes the deictic rule of the matrix clause in the first case and follows it
in the latter, or$
$ 2) that in the case that they are temporally
dependent, the deictic rule is not applicable in the cycle where the relative
or complement clause is generated and after substitution a "consecutio
temporum"-rule is applied for finite (and vacuously for infinite) subclauses.
In that case it is not
necessary to have two places for substitution for subclauses with respect to
the temporal rules. In view of the iso-scheme the second solution should be
preferred, because the first one would make the scheme more complex.
Instead of a consecutio-temporum-rule also a supertense
parameter could be used or the subclauses could be made temporary paraphrases
for a superdeixis attribute, temporary because only one would be accepted with
the substitution after the temporal rules of the main clause. Because the
temporal rules follow the proposition substitution rules the check has to be
postponed.$   
$ I also propose that finite and non-finite complement clauses are
treated in principle
as being possible translation equivalents or language internally
spoken, paraphrases. Differences in finiteness are not expressed in the IL.
Other restrictions, e.g. properties of the matrix verb, class or mood,
should  filter them out if necessary. It is, of course, possible to express
some preference for the form used in the source language adding some
"feature" to the IL-expression that can cause a "translation bonus" (see
Lisette en Carel (67)). This proposal also implies that the translation
relation between finite and non-finite complement clauses will
now be symmetric in contrast with the Rosetta2 treatment where finite clauses
were never translated into non-finite ones.$

$ This proposal boils down to the following situation:$
$ (I will give here the temporary paraphrases solution instead of the supertense
parameter solution, although they are as far as I can see equivalent as the
parameter would only be used to filter out temporary paraphrases in an earlier
phase)$

$ There are to kinds of subclauses: 1) temporally dependent and 2) temporally
independent subclauses. This is a translation relevant distinction which will
be carried out by different deixis rules.$

1) Temporally dependent clauses

$ - Deictic rules for finite
dependent subclauses are all applied. Their meaning is
only deictic dependency or "no deictic time".
They give the superdeixis attribute a value and
the deixis value of the clause remains unmarked. The verb receives the
appropriate deictic form.
This results in temporary paraphrases with respect to deixis.$
$ - All possible finite and infinite forms are made (depending on the aspect
value; see below): indicative and subjunctive
finite forms, infinitive, ingform, gerundio, present participle forms.$
$ - the matrix-deictic value of the clause will be used for
checking it with the deictic value of the matrix clause.$
$ - disambiguation with respect to the form of the verb is decided on when$
1) it is known that it is a complement clause:
for complement clause the possible forms are: indicative and subjunctive finite 
forms, infinitive, ingform, gerundio
2) the clause is substituted:
- which form has to be chosen depends on properties of the matrix-verb or adverb
- the matrix-deictic value will be checked as soon as the deixis value of the
  matrix clause is known (or will be checked with the parameter)
$ Semantically, it means that the events of the matrix clause and the subclause
share their R%S%-points.$

2) Temporally independent clauses

$ - the deictic rules for main clauses are applicable. Only one
is applied. The matrix-deictic value will remain unmarked.$

$ - All possible forms are made.$
$ I am not sure if
there exist infinite 
independent complement clauses in all languages;
the only ones that could be independent I know
have retrospective aspect, a retrospective
aspect that should be interpreted as a perfective past (see below) or a future
interpretation as e.g. in: _Hij beloofde morgen te komen_$
$ But maybe _morgen_ should not be interpreted here as a deictic adverbial but
as an absolute adverbial which is allowed in dependent clauses.$

$ - The matrix-deictic value will be used in case of complement clause to check
if an independent complement clause is allowed.$

$ - Disambiguation with respect to the form of the verb is again done:$
1) when the kind of clause is known
2) when the clause is substituted; the matrix-verb specifies if finite or
   infinite clauses are allowed and if these clauses are temporally dependent
   or may be temporally independent. Verbs that allow for temporally independent
   complement clauses are e.g. _say_, _think_.

$ Semantically, it means that the R%S%-points differ for the matrix and the sub
clause.$

$ Main clauses and temporally independent subclauses are very similar with
respect to time. The difference is that main clauses do not allow for infinite
forms. (Imperative clauses are main
clauses without deictic time).$
$ Temporally independent clauses cannot be translated into XPPROPtonoCLAUSE-
expressions as I do not see what the deictic rule equivalent would be.$

$ I propose that only complement clauses with an explicit
own deictic adverbial or the
abstract adverbial REF (the point of speech) if that differs from the reference
adverbial in the matrix clause will be seen as temporally independent complement
clauses in Rosetta3 to avoid explosion of ambiguities. In Rosetta4 we can take
into account possible anaphoric reference adverbials with antecedents in other
sentences. In Rosetta3, only an explicit deictic adverbial or the point of
speech as antecedent of a reference adverbial (REF) will cause temporally
independent complement clauses.$

$ Note that that the superdeixis attribute of the clause substitutes the
supertense
attribute of Rosetta2.$
$ Note also that which kind of clause is generated is not known until the mood
determination rules are applied in the iso-scheme. This means that all kind of
infinite and finite forms are made by the finiteness transformations as far as
allowed by the aspect rules
and that some are rejected if necessary in the
mooddetermination rules.$

_Aspect and Retrospectivity_
$ Until now I only treated the deictic relation of the subclauses as that seems
to be the most important issue. But something has to be said about the
aspectual relation too, because that was an obligatory rule in section 3 and
because of the problems with infinite complement clauses mentioned in section
6.$

1) Temporally dependent clauses

$ Although they do not have their own deictic time, they can have their own
aspectual time. This means that event interval of the subclause can have another
relation to the reference interval R%E%
than the event interval of matrix clause.
But the reference interval R%S% that is related to S
must be the same for both events.$
$ There are also clauses with
"no aspectual time" or default, habitual aspect.
This means that the event is not really
tied to any reference interval at all, i.e. not placed at the time-axis. This
is the case with the complement clauses of e.g. _graag/like_, _aan het V zijn_.$

$ The temporally dependent complement clause without or with default habitual
aspect is also the
one that corresponds to XPPROPtonoCLAUSE-expressions.$

$ Clauses that have "no aspect" or habitual aspect
cannot have retrospective aspect. Clauses that 
have perfective or imperfective
aspect also can have retrospective aspect in principle.
Only the reference interval R%S%
that is related to S must be the same for the event of the matrix clause and
the event of the subclause. But the retrospective aspect rule has no equivalent
rule in the XPPROPtonoCLSAUSE grammars. so if this optional rule is applied
there will not be isomorphy between XPPROPtoCLAUSE and the XPPROPtonoCLAUSE
grammars.$


2) Temporally independent clauses

$ Temporally independent clauses behave like main clauses and always have own
aspectual time (perfective, imperfective, habitual, retrospective).$
$ These clauses can never be translated into XPPROPtonoCLAUSE-expressions.$
$ I do not know whether
there exist infinite perfective, imperfective, habitual or retrospective
independent complement clauses in all languages.
$ There may be a problem with infinite clauses with retrospective aspect,
because it is not clear to me if in English an infinite clause with _have_
can be paraphrased by a finite clause in the _simple past tense_.$

example:
     (134) ?John regrets to have seen him yesterday
     (135) John regrets that he saw him yesterday

$ In Dutch this is not a problem, because the v.t.t. is ambiguous between
retrospective aspect + present deixis and  perfective aspect + special past
deixis.$

_Finiteness transformations_
$ The finiteness transformations are applied after the aspect rules (aspect
and retrospectivity). in the following scheme is indicated which verb forms
(modus) are made for the first (auxiliary) verb in English and Spanish and
the last verb in Dutch, that are meant to be the forms for complement clauses.$

aspect                       finite                        infinite

perfective                   indicative                    infinitive
                             subjunctive

imperfective                 indicative                    infinitive
                             subjunctive

habitual                     indicative                    infinitive
                             subjunctive                   ingform (English)

retrospective                indicative                    infinitive
                             subjunctive

$ In English the infinitive form of the auxiliary _be_ of the imperfective
aspect has to be deleted. This will avoid
sentences like:$

_The complements of modals, adverb/verb and adjective/verb translations_

$ The class of modals is a class of basic expressions of different syntactic
categories that express the "semantic concepts" _necessity_, _possibility_,
_obligation_, _ability_, _volition_, _future_ etc. Most of them take
propositional complements. There are two problems with them:$
1) the modal verbs have characteristics of main and auxiliary verbs
2) translation equivalents are often not of the same syntactic category
$ The class of translation equivalent
expressions that have different syntactic categories in
languages show certain characteristics which I will sum up here as far as I
observed them. I will also give a first indication how they can be treated
in Rosetta3
with respect to time.$

$ The class of verbs that can be translated into adverbials seems not to
allow for retrospective aspect and - like statives - only to allow for habitual
and perfective aspect. This means in English that they cannot have a
progeressive form, but that they can have in Spanish perfective and imperfective
(for the habitual aspect) form.$
$ They also cannot be passivized.$

$ Some modals like the English _shall/will_,
_might_ or verbs like _happen_ and their
translation equivalents _zullen_, _misschien_ and _toevallig_ take an
infinite temporally dependent clause.
They do not have
retrospective aspect. If that seems to be the case then it is due to the
"clustering" of some modal and auxiliary verbs in Dutch (and Spanish):$

     (151) Hij zou het gedaan hebben  ---> Hij had het zullen doen
     (152) Debe haber escrito la carta   ---> Ha debido escribir la carta

$ In these cases the status of "complement clause" has to be changed into main
clause as they are all adverbials or auxiliary verbs (just as in the
 _graag_-case). If the modal verbs would be
treated as main verbs this is not necessary, of course.
It is also possible that we
introduce infinite main clauses, but that seems to be intuitively bad
In case of auxiliaries and
adverbials the superdeixis value
of the complement clause
has to be changed to _unmarked_ (because of getting possibly main sentence).
Changing a value that had already been assigned is not very elegant, but in this
case it is due to the fact that the deictic rules "came to early". Remember that
the approach with the superdeixis attribute was chosen to "imitate" the scope
of the deictic rules.$

$ Modals like _kunnen_, _moeten_, _can_, _possible_ etc. take temporally
independent or
dependent complement clauses. Maybe the differences between these kind of
complement clauses coincides with the different interpretations of some of
them. But this has to be investigated. The possibilities also can express the
scope differences between the modal and temporal operators.$

$TI 7.3. Relative clauses
$ In general, relative clauses behave like complement clauses as described in
section 7.2.. The difference is, that they have other infinite forms and that
there are more restrictions with respect to infinite forms. I assume that
infinite and finite relative clauses can be translation equivalents just as I
did for complement clauses. The possible forms for relative clauses are:$
- indicative and subjunctive finite forms 
- ingform, gerundio, present participles as infinite forms
  (I do not consider here infinitive forms as e.g. in Dutch: de _te lezen_
   boeken, which have some passive, modal interpretation: de boeken die
   gelezen _moeten/kunnen_ worden)

_Deixis_
$ Relative clauses also fall into two classes:$
$ 1) _temporally independent_, i.e. outside the scope of the deictic rule of the
clause of the NP in which the relative clause is substituted.$
$ 2) _temporally dependent_, i.e. within the scope of the deictic rule of the
clause of the NP in which the clause is substituted.$
$ I will use the same attribute _matris-deixis_ (supertense) to cope with the
deictic scope aspects as in the complement clauses. Note that the NP now must
have also a superdeixis attribute. The value of this attribute can be
translated by an _external parameter_ as in Rosetta2 or the approach of
_temporary paraphrases_ (possibly in combination with a pre-action-like method
to avoid explosion of paraphrases) can be used.$

_Aspect and Retrospectivity_
$ Finite relative clauses do not differ from finite complement clauses.$
$ Infinite relative clauses are put to many restrictions that differ over the
languages:$
Some observations:

_Dutch_
$ Infinite relative clauses with present participle form are allowed before
the noun (anterelclause in Rosetta2), but too many arguments or adverbials in
them tend to make them odd or "heavy". Probably some accent conventions are
involved; with contrastive accent they are more acceptable most of the time.
Complement clauses as argument are not
allowed. The reason for this was suggested in Jan (47) on ergatives: the verb
has to be adjacent to the noun and clauses have to be extraposed.$

$ Temporal adverbials seem to be allowed sometimes:$

    (162) ?Ik zie de gisteren appels etende man
    (163) ?Ik zie de gisteren etende man
    (164)  Ik zag gisteren de nu appels etende man
    (165)  Ik zag gisteren de hier nu al 10 jaar wonende man

$ Infinite relative clauses in present participle form are not allowed after
the noun except for some "absolute" reading:$

     (166) Ik zag de man, appels etend

$ This only occurs in dependent relative clauses.$
$ The same holds for infinite retrospective relative clauses with _hebben_:$

     (167) ?Ik zag de man appels gegeten hebbende 
     (168)  Ik zie de gisteren appels gegeten hebbende man

$ But all infinite retrospective relative clauses with _hebbende_ before the
noun should get a
lower bonus with respect to the finite ones. The reason for this could be the
same as mentioned above: _hebbende_ must be adjacent to the noun and in Dutch
there is a rule that moves _hebben_ from that position.$

$ Infinite retrospective relative clauses with _zijnde_ (passives and ergatives)
form a different case. _Zijnde_ must be deleted in clauses before the noun
and they do not show the akwardness of the _hebbende_-clauses.
Arguments and adverbials in these clauses make them "heavy" too. With
contrastive accent they are more acceptable. After the noun
they also have the "absolute" interpretation. (_Geworden_ has already been
deleted in the case of passives.)$

     (169) de gewassen (zijnde) gordijnen
     (170) de naar Groningen gereden (zijnde) man
     (171) de aangekomen (zijnde) kinderen

     (172) de gordijnen, gewassen zijnde,
     (173) de man, naar Groningen gereden zijnde,

$ I think that clauses with present participle form, except for the ones with
the retrospective auxiliary verb, always have an habitual interpretation.
Clauses with non-stative events have next to that interpretation
an actual interpretation that corresponds to the interpretation of a clause
with _aan het V
zijnde_ (with perfective aspect). Maybe clauses with stative events have an
actual perfective
interpretation, but I am not sure about that.
Clauses with time adverbials tend to have an actual
interpretation, but maybe they
can also refer to "an actual time of the habit" analogous
to a perfective aspect of a stative event.$

    (174) de etende ezel                de ezel die eet (hab.)
                                        de ezel die aan het eten is
    (175) de gisteren etende ezel       de ezel die gisteren aan het eten was
                                        ?de ezel die gisteren at (hab.)
    (176) de al 10 jaar etende ezel     ?de ezel die al 10 jaar eet (hab.)
                                        de ezel die al 10 jaar aan het eten is

$ Clauses with retrospective aspect (_hebben_) have an actual 
interpretation.$

    (177) de appels gegeten hebbende ezel      de ezel die appels gegeten heeft
    (178) de al 10 jaar appels etende ezel     de ezel die al 10 jaar appels
                                               aan het eten is

_Spanish_
$ The present participle form -nte is not productive anymore. If it exists,
it is more an adjective, that with _ser_ expresses the habitual aspect and with
_estar_ the actual aspect.$
$ In Spanish all forms are put after the noun. Infinite forms with the
_gerundio_ are found but always have an "absolute" character:$

     (179) el hombre ya viviendo aqui@' durante 10 an@~os
     (180) el hombre habiendo comido manzanas
     (181) el hombre comiendo manzanas

_English_

$ Infinite relative clauses with ingform are allowed before the noun
(anterelclause) if they do not contain any argument, adverbial or auxiliary.$

     (182) the eating man
     (183) *the apples eating man
     (184) *the yesterday eating man
     (185) *the having eaten man

$ They are allowed after the noun:$

     (186) the man eating apples
     (187) the man eating yesterday
     (189) the man having eaten

$ But they have next to an actual interpretation corresponding to a clause
with "locative" _be_ + ingform or retrospective aspect, an "absolute"
interpretation that can be paraphrased with _while_ or _after_ only found in
dependent clauses.$
    
     (190) I saw a man, dying, ...

$ The deletion of passive and retrospective auxiliary seems to be
more restricted:$

     (191) *the arrived man
     (192) *the hit children

but  (193) the fallen book
     (194) the broken window

$ Maybe _fallen_ and _broken_ should be considered adjectives here.$

$ I think that the clauses before the noun always have an habitual
interpretation next to the actual interpretation corresponding to _be_ + ingform
for non-statives and maybe perfective aspect for statives. The clauses after the
noun show the same ambiguity, but as in Dutch I think that those with time
adverbials or retrospective aspect tend to have an actual interpretation.$
$ All clauses after the noun also have an "absolute" interpretation.$
$ The clauses with retrospective aspect will have a strong preference for
"absolute" interpretation.$

     (195) the eating donkey       the donkey that eats
                                   the donkey that is eating

     (196) the donkey eating       the donkey that eats apples
                        apples     the donkey that is eating apples
                                   the donkey, while it is eating apples,

     (197) the donkey eating       the donkey that was eating apples yesterday
               apples yesterday    ?the donkey that ate apples yesterday (hab.)
                                   the donkey, while he was eating apples yest.,

     (198) the donkey having eaten the donkey, after he has eaten apples
                            apples the donkey that has eaten apples

     (199) the donkey having been  the donkey that has been eating appels for
          eating apples for 10     10 years
                            years

$ Summarizing, we can say that with respect to aspect of restrictive (i.e.
not "absolute") relative clauses:$

$ A) infinite relative clauses with ingform (Eng) and present participle form
   (Du) of the main verb can have:$

$ 1) Habitual aspect (or "no aspect")$
$ These clauses are isomorphic with XPPROPtonoClAUSE, e.g. ADJPPROPtonoCLAUSE.
It indicates  a property, in Spanish expressed by _ser_ in the ADJPPROPtoCLAUSE
grammar. Spanish has no infinite clauses of this kind. Most of such clauses
have to be
translated into finite Spanish ones. English and Dutch both allow for such
clauses,
but differ in place restrictions, i.e. before or after the noun. They
occur in the dependent and independent class. 

$ 2) Actual aspect$
$ These clauses indicate a "temporary property", in Spanish expressed by _estar_
in the XPPROPtoCLAUSE grammar. They have perfective aspect for clauses with
stative events (but these are rare)
and perfective aspect for the "locative" tense of clauses with
non-stative events. The auxiliary of this locative tense is deleted.$
$ In Dutch the infinitive is transformed into a present participle form.$

be + ingform          --> ingform
aan het inf. zijn     --> inf. ( --> inf.de)

$ B) infinite clauses with _having_ (Eng) and _hebbende_ or present participle
form with a retrospective adverbial (Du) can have:$

$ Retrospective aspect with imperfective, perfective or habitual aspect$

$ Clauses with _having_ and _hebbende_ are less acceptable; in English they
are placed behind the noun and tend to have an "absolute" reading, in Dutch
they are placed before the noun in the not "absolute" interpretation and
there is a rule for moving _hebben_ which yields a situation in which the verb
in present participle form is not adjacent anymore to
the noun, which is not allowed.$

$ Note that clauses with habitual aspect can occur with retrospective
aspect; retrospectivity of the "habit", "property" or "state", that then is
"actualized" or placed on the time-axis. They show the same (un)acceptability
with retrospective aspect as other stative, habitual verbs (see section 5.2.).$
$ XPPROPtonoCLAUSE grammars do not have an equivalent for retrospectivity.$

C) infinite clauses with past participle form (Du)

$ Retrospective aspect with perfective or habitual aspect$
 
$ In case of passives and ergatives the auxiliary (passive and/or
retrospectivity) must be deleted in Dutch.$

$ With respect to non-restictive ("absolute") infinite relative clauses we can
say that they must be placed behind the noun and that they occur in Dutch
(present participle form), English (ingform) and Spanish (gerundio).
They occur in temporally dependent clauses. Maybe they are infinite
adverbial clauses (see also section 7.4.).$

$ With respect to the aspect of these clauses we can say that they behave like
the restrictive clauses considering the following facts:$

$ - Spanish is like English$
$ - There is no habitual aspect$
$ - In Dutch the auxiliaries _zijn_ and _aan het V zijn_ are not deleted but
get the present participle form$

The forms assigned in the finiteness rules are as in the following scheme:

_aspect_                     _finite_                        _infinite_

perfective                 indicative                    infinitive
                           subjunctive                   (gerundio (Spanish))

imperfective               indicative                    infinitive
                           subjunctive                   (gerundio (Spanish))

habitual                   indicative                    infinitive (Dutch)
                           subjunctive                   ingform (English)

retrospective              indicative                    infinitive
                           subjunctive                   ingform (English)
                                                         (gerundio (Spanish))

$ Note that the gerundio in Spanish only occurs in non-restrictive infinite
(or maybe adverbial) clauses.$

_Transformations_

_English_
$ In English the auxiliary _be_ for imperfective aspect has to be deleted in
infinite forms. (See also section 7.2.) 
The auxiliary of the "local tense" has to be deleted
if it is an infinite relative clause.$

_Dutch_
$ In Dutch the verb gets a present participle form if it
is a relative infinite clause.
The auxiliary of the "local tense" has to be deleted if it is a restrictive
infinite relative clause.
The 
auxiliary _zijn_ in passive or ergative retrospective clauses has to be deleted
in restrictive infinite relative clauses.
In non-restrictive relative infinite
clauses in Dutch these auxiliaries do not have to be deleted.$

$TI 7.4. Adverbial clauses

$ Adverbial clauses are clauses that function like adverbs. They contain most
of the time a
_conjunction_ and can be seen as CONJP's if we consider the conjunction the
head of this clause. In the CONJP-subgrammar then, the conjunction takes as
argument a clause:$

example:
                         CONJP
                         /  \
                        /    \
                       /      \
                    CONJ      CL
                     |       /  \
                    als      Piet hem slaat

$ If the conjunction is overt, the clause has to be finite. If the conjunction
is not overt, the clause can be infinite.$

examples:

    (207)  Terwijl hij hem sloeg, had hij er al spijt van.
    (208)  Hem slaande had hij er al spijt van.

    (209)  Nadat hij hem geslagen had, had hij er spijt van
    (210)  Hem geslagen hebbend, had hij er spijt van

$ Many of the infinite relative clauses of the preceding section have such
an adverbial interpretation.$

$ With respect to time I distinct two classes of adverbial clauses:$
1. temporal clauses
2. non-temporal clauses
$TI 7.4.1. Temporal adverbial clauses
$ Temporal adverbial clauses are clauses with an (overt or non-overt)
time conjunction.$
$ Time conjunctions are e.g.:$

  Dutch                   English                   Spanish

  toen                     when                      cuando
  terwijl                  while                     mientras
  nadat                    after                     despue@'s de que
  voordat                  before                    antes de que

$ As can be seen with the examples given in section 7.1., temporal adverbial
clauses are always temporally dependent.$
$ The clauses that are taken as argument by the conjunction behave like normal
finite clauses with respect to time (see section 3).$
$ The conjunctions have certain inherent temporal properties and can put
restrictions to their arguments. The resulting adverbial clause will have
temporal properties that are due to the conjunction and/or the argument.$
These temporal adverbial clauses function as other referential
temporal adverbials and can
be taken as arguments of temporal rules (i.e aspectual and retrospective
rules). See further section 3.2.2. and 3.2.4.1. on temporal adverbials.$
$TI 7.4.2. Non-temporal adverbial clauses
$ Non-temporal adverbial clauses are clauses with a non-temporal conjunction,
e.g. clauses with _omdat_, _want_, _hoewel_, _als_ etc.$
$ These clauses are temporally independent and behave as main clauses as
described in section 3.$
$NP
$TI 8. Remaining problems
$ In this section some remaining problems will be discussed.$

$ - I expect that other "aspectual
forms" such as inchoative, terminative etc. can be added at the "Aktionsart
level" or
"aspect
level" and that the current approach,
which allows for translation of adverbs into auxiliary verbs or combinations
of them (and vice versa) will be sufficient to cope
with
them. This means that they are treated categorematically
like  _graag/like_ and _be/aan het V
zijn_  or syncategoremattically and added to the class of aspect or
retrospectivity rules or new classes of that kind (e.g. prospectivity rules).$

$ - Other topics that should be elaborated are
frequency and habitual aspects.
I introduced a first proposal for habitual aspect in section 5.
I expect
that frequency aspects will have to do with
aspect and Aktionsart as the distinctions of perfective/imperfective/habitual
aspect and the durative/non-durative Aktionsarten have some
relation with count/mass distinctions.$

$ - As frequency and duration are measure expressions, this topic should also
be further elaborated.$

$ - The time theory presented here should of course be embedded in a
discourse theory about time. The anaphoric properties should
be seen as a start. A good theory in this respect could help to desambiguate
between the set of possible translations.$

$ - Moreover, the informal specification of the time model should be given a
more
formal account.$

$ - There is an interaction of modality in the future
time expressions: Is the auxiliary verb of the future time a temporal or
modal auxiliary verb? In this proposal I did not treat for example the future
of the past which I consider rather modal.$

     (211) Hij zou komen (maar hij is niet gekomen)
     (212) Hij zei dat hij zou komen

$ In the last example, an indirect speech example, it is not clear if we should
consider the _zou komen_ a modal or a
future that is dependent of the past deictic rule of the
matrix clause. If we treat future as modality, the verb _zullen_ will be a full
verb that can have present and past tense and takes an infinitive temporally
dependent clause as a
complement just like most of the other modal verbs. The problem is that it
does not allow itself perfect tenses and in English not even an infinitive
form. Moreover, in Spanish it is not even a verb but a morphological morpheme.
But it will not be the only modal verb with such problems (cf. also section 
7.2.).$

$ Possible solutions to these problems are:$

$ 1) Treat _zullen_ and its equivalents as  full verbs that are introduced
categoremattically (in Spanish there will be an abstract basic expression for
it). By proposition substitution they take an infinite temporally dependent
complement clause like other modals. They
only allow for perfective aspect and do not allow
for retrospectivity. (Future tenses are often considered to be perfective
tenses, cf. Comrie)
In the deictic rules they get past or present tense by
the rules for main (independent) or dependent clauses.$
   zullen + [x komen]  -->
   x zullen komen (proposition substitution and raising) -->
 a) x zullen komen (finiet)
 b) x zullen komen (infiniet)
a: 1) x zal komen (present deictic rule for main clauses)
   2) x zou komen (past deictic rule for main clauses)
   3) x zal komen (present deictic rule for dependent clauses)
   4) x zou komen (past deictic rule for dependent clauses)
b: 1) x zullen komen (present rule for dependent clauses)
   2) x zullen komen (past rule for dependent clauses)

a1: Hij zal komen
a2: hij zou komen
a3: Ik verwacht dat hij zal komen
a4: Ik verwachtte dat hij zou komen
b1: Hij verwacht te zullen komen
b2: Hij verwachtte te zullen komen

$ Note that b1 and b2 are not possible in English and Spanish. Maybe a bare
infinitive would be possible.$

$ 2) We introduce a prospectivity rule class ordered after the retrospectivity
rule class. It introduces syncategoremattivcally
the future auxiliaries and morphemes (attributes).
After these rules the finiteness transformations and the deictic rules are
applied as in 1).$
$NP
$TI 9. Morphological component and dictionary
$ For clarity reasons I will summarize in this section the implications of this
proposal for temporal expressions in the morphological component and the
dictionary as far as I saw them.$
$TI 9.1. Morphological component
$ The input for the morphological component deviates from the input in the
Rosetta2 system in the following way:$
$ the tense form attributes of the VERB with respect to time
are split in two or three parts, namely _deixis_
and _modus_ and, if necessary, _aspect_;
they do not contain information about
person or number as was sometimes the case
in the Rosetta2 system. This is due to the fact that in
this proposal
agreement does not take place in these rules as in Rosetta2, as this phenomenon
has nothing to do with time. This proposal leaves open whether
the subject must have
been substituted already or whether the variables must have features for
person,
number or gender. I suppose that the actual
morphological verb forms can be computed
from the above mentioned temporal attributes and attributes for person, number,
gender and mood form (declarative, imperative, subjuntivo) which will be
accounted for elsewhere.$
$TI 9.2. Dictionary
$ As was already mentioned above, this proposal for temporal expressions
implies that most of the basic
categories (probably NOUN, PREP, ADV, and CONJ)
must have temporal attributes. We can start by giving them all the
default values and adapting the relevant ones by hand. VERBs are deviating from
other basic categories in this respect. They only have one inherent attribute,
namely _class_.
The other attributes are attributes
that determine the morphological form of the verb.$
$ The proposed attributes with their values can be found in section 3.2. on
S-trees.$
$NP
$TI 10. Remaining Rosetta2 topics
$ Finally, I want to sum up where the phenomena that were treated in the time
rules in Rosetta2 will be treated in this proposal.$

_Imperatives_
$ Imperatives are generated as follows:$
- habitual or no aspect
- finite
- no deixis or deixis transformations
- imperative mood (condition: main clause) --> appropriate tense

$ The passive auxiliary is introduced in or after
the subjectdemotion rules if necessary. The participle form _geworden_ of the
passive auxiliary will be deleted after an applied retrospective rule in Dutch
by a transformation.$

$ Agreement is a separate transformation in the VERBPPROPtoCLAUSE-grammar. It
will account for the appropriate values of the attributes person, number and
gender of the VERB.$

$ The reflexive pronoun and particle are spelled out in the VERBPPROPformation
grammar in separate transformations.$

$ The supertense attribute is replaced by a "superdeixis-attribute", because
the name represents the meaning better in this theory, but this is not really
necessary.$
$NP
$TI Notes
$LD 5
$ 1) I use the definition of "aspect" of Comrie
(1976),
but I will take his term "situation" as referring to the
interval E in relation to the reference interval R%E% and consider only two
possibilities: "perfective" and "imperfective" aspect.
The notion "perfect aspect" which I call
"retrospective aspect"
should be accounted for by other relations. Probably,
by relating R%E% to R%S% with the relation "until".$

$ 2) This point resembles the point S' in Oversteegen and Verkuyl (1985).$
