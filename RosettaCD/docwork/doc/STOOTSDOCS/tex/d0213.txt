\section{Introduction}

As far as the purely linguistic aspects are concerned,
the task of the transfer modules for a particular language
should follow from the
definition of the semantic component of the M-grammar of that language. 
In doc. R0011 the transfer in Rosetta2 was described in this way; 
it was defined in a completely local way, in terms of rules that
were applied to each node separately. 
However, even in Rosetta2 the implemented transfer modules had other tasks too
(cf. R0014), following from extra-linguistic considerations. The
disambiguating interaction with the user and the preference tests
(both very rudimentary) took 
place in these modules. Preference tests are typically
of a non-local nature, because they check whether various parts of
an expression are compatible.

So, in Rosetta2 we had a separation between purely local - 
and therefore compositional - assignment of meanings according to
the semantic component of the M-grammar and a possibly non-local
processing of extra-linguistic information.
  
In Rosetta3 phenomena like semi-idioms appear to necessitate the introduction
of non-locality in the linguistic semantic component as well. (Note:
in these cases the transfer {\sl action}, i.e. the meaning assignment, is still local
but the applicability of that action may depend on the context.)
It has to be investigated if this is indeed the case and in what way it
will influence our notion of compositionality. 

What is presented here, is a technically rather powerful definition of
the transfer modules, which can be implemented without too many complications.
Where the exact line between linguistic and extra-linguistic knowledge
should be drawn, must be decided later..

Maybe some of the possibilities offered here will turn out to be
unnecessary and undesirable
from a theoretical point of view. In that case we may decide later on 
not to make use of these possibilities.


\section{Overview of the transfer modules}

Transfer in Rosetta3, i.e. the transition from syntactic derivation trees
of the source language to syntactic derivation trees of the target
language, via semantic derivation trees, consists of three parts:

\begin{enumerate}

\item A-TRANSFER. 

Input: a set of syntactic derivation trees,

Output: a set of semantic derivation trees.

The resulting semantic derivation trees need not be semantically correct,
i.e. the trees may contain partial functions which are 
applied to arguments outside their domain.

\item IL-TEST. 

Input: a set of semantic derivation trees.

            Output: a set of correct semantic derivation trees, a subset of
            the input set, ordered according to plausibility.

Both A-TRANSFER and IL-TEST belong to the analysis module of Rosetta. 
Obviously, IL-TEST can be seen as a part of A-TRANSFER, but it
appears to be more elegant to make it a separate module.


\item G-TRANSFER. 

Input: a semantic derivation tree.

Output: a set of - possibly incorrect - syntactic 
derivation trees.

\end{enumerate}

\begin{enumerate}
\item[Ad 1.] A-TRANSFER is performed on the basis of transfer rules for
M-rules and for Skeys. In general these rules are local (i.e. their
applicability does not depend on the context), 
but there are exceptions, in particular for semi-idioms.
The resulting set of semantic derivation trees  may contain
incorrect trees, because in certain cases (again: semi-idioms)
a test in terms of meaning keys has to be done yet.

\item[Ad 2.] IL-TEST performs compatibility tests on the semantic derivation
trees. The result is that some of them may be judged incorrect and that
all correct ones will get 
a strong and a weak preference bonus.
The most plausible among the correct trees (plausible according to 
the bonuses), is selected and passed to G-TRANSFER. If the user asks
for another interpretation, the next best is passed on, etc.

In the interactive mode the disambiguating dialogue with the
user on polysemous words 
takes place in this module, after the compatibility tests. 
The result of the dialogue 
is a subset of selected trees from
the set of correct semantic derivation trees, from which the most plausible 
is passed to G-TRANSFER.
 

\item[Ad 3.] The selected semantic derivation tree is transduced into a set of
syntactic derivation trees of the target language.

G-TRANSFER performs the transfer on the basis of transfer rules for
IL-rules and for Mkeys. In general these rules are local, 
but there are exceptions, in particular for semi-idioms.
There is a large degree of symmetry between G-TRANSFER and A-TRANSFER
(for the same language),
but we will not assume that in the implemented system 
exactly the same transfer rules and dictionaries
are used in both modules.

\end{enumerate}

In section 5 we will specify these modules in more detail.


\section{Syntactic and semantic derivation trees}

Before defining the transfer functions we have to define on what objects
they operate.

 \bigskip

A semantic derivation tree is defined as follows:
First we specify:
\begin{enumerate}
\item A set of basic IL expressions. These are in the first place
meaning keys, mkeys. Other kinds of basic IL expressions are
variables, numbers (in ciphers) and strings (for unknown words). 
These are not identified by keys,
but by  other attributes, which identify the index in case of variables,
the  numerical value in case of numbers and the symbol string in case
of strings. The details of this are left to the implementors.

\item A set of meaning rules, i.e. their names. These names may consist of a 
rulename alone or of a rulename plus parameter values. For each
rule it has to be specified what parameters it has and what the types
of these parameters are. 
For each meaning rule the 
number of arguments is fixed and equal to the number of arguments of
the corresponding syntactic M-rules. (There is one exception: the 
meaning rule corresponding to the robustness rule that 
is used
if M-PARSER fails, does not have a fixed number of arguments.)
 
\end{enumerate}

Definition of semantic derivation trees:

1. Basic IL expressions are semantic derivation trees.

2. If \(e_{1}, . . . , e_{n}\) are semantic derivation trees and 
\(\underline{M}_{i}\)
 is the name
of a meaning rule with n arguments,
then \(\underline{M}_{i}< e_{1}, . . . , e_{n} >\)
 is a semantic derivation tree.

A syntactic derivation tree is defined in a similar way, but with skeys
instead of mkeys, and M-rules instead of meaning rules. Here too special
attention has to be given to the representation of variables, numbers
and strings.


With each node of a derivation tree bonuses are associated in the way
described in section 4.

\section{Bonus system}

We assume the following bonus system:
there are two kinds of bonuses: (morpho-)syntactic 
and semantic bonuses. Each of them consist of triples of integers

(correctness bonus, strong preference bonus, weak preference bonus),

to be abbreviated as

\( (cb, spb, wpb) \),

or 

\( (syncb, synspb, synwpb) \)

and

\( (semcb, semspb, semwpb) \),

for syntactic and semantic bonuses respectively.

 \bigskip
S-trees and syntactic derivation trees have only syntactic bonuses.
Semantic derivation trees have syntactic and semantic bonuses.

Each node of a tree has a bonus. The bonus of a tree is the sum
of the bonuses
of its nodes. The sum is computed for each kind of bonus separately.

The way bonuses are transported from one level of the system to another
level, has to be defined yet. The best way to do it seems to
be to compute the bonus of the complete expression first and to transport
this to its translation at the next level.
But this approach appears to be in conflict
with the use of compact representations of sets of trees (supertrees etc.).
So presumably we have to define the transport of bonuses for each subtree
separately, e.g. the way in which the bonuses in an S-tree are transported to
the rulenode of the corresponding derivation tree, when an M-rule is applied.

The ordering of triples of bonuses is defined as follows:

     \( (cb1,spb1,wpb1) > (cb2,spb2,wpb2) =_{def}\)

     \( cb1 > cb2   \) or

     \(       cb1 = cb2 \) and \( spb1 > spb2   \) or

     \( cb1 = cb2 \) and \( spb1 = spb2 \) and \( wpb1 > wpb2 \)


The start value of the bonuses is 0.
Changes in bonuses may be prescribed in rules, in dictionary entries, etc.
This has to be decided in each module separately.

 \bigskip
{\bf Correctness bonus.} The correctness bonus indicates the correctness (syntactic or semantic) of the
construction under consideration.

So, cb := cb - 1 if incorrectness is noticed. 
In general, robustness measures will
lead to a negative correctness bonus. For a correct expression 
the correctness
bonus will be 0, for an incorrect expression it will be negative. 

The
reason that correctness is indicated by an integer and not by a boolean is that
if in robustness mode a choice has to be made between several incorrect 
expressions we may prefer expressions with the minimal number of incorrect
elements.

At certain points in the system, e.g. after each module, the
set of results should be inspected and if there are both correct and
incorrect results the incorrect ones are deleted. (this appears to be a
reasonable strategy, taking into account that expressions that are judged
incorrect will never become correct anymore.) 

 \bigskip

{\bf weak preference bonus.} The weak 
preference bonus is intended to fulfil the same function
as the bonus in Rosetta2. If there are several
interpretations (S-trees or  derivation trees, etc.) of the same phrase,
the weak preference bonus may be used to express that, 
all other things being equal, one interpretation is more `plausible' or
`probable' or `frequent' than the other. 

 \bigskip

{\bf Strong preference bonus} The 
strong preference bonus spb has a strength somewhere between cb and wpb. 
It has the power
to overrule several weak preferences. An example of its use 
might be the preference
one would like to give to idioms over literal interpretations.
Consider for example "kick the bucket". In the literal interpretation it
might get a positive wpb, thanks to the compatibility of the kind
of object expected by "kick" and the kind of object "bucket" is. 
The idiomatic interpretation will not get this positive bonus, because
"bucket" is no argument in that interpretation. This can be overruled
by making for each idiom spb := spb + 1. This seems to be a more
reliable strategy than having only a weak preference bonus and 
adding a large number to it, e.g. wpb := wpb + 25, in order
to overrule other preferences.

 \bigskip

At the IL level (at the end of the IL-TEST) a preference ordering has to be made
on the basis of syntactic and semantic bonuses. For the time being we will assume
that for each IL expression they are simply added 

\( (syncb + semcb, synspb + semspb, synwpb + semwpb) \)

and then compared to
each other in the beforementioned way. But of course the distinction between
the syntactic and the semantic bonuses is made with the expectation
that a more subtle comparison will be made in the future.

\section{Transfer rules and dictionaries}


\subsection{A-TRANSFER}


The analytical transfer function A-TRANSFER 
from syntactic derivation trees to sets of 
semantic derivation trees is defined by 
specification of:
\begin{enumerate}

\item the dictionary A-ILDICT.
\item a function A-RULETRANSFER from M-rules to sets of 
meaning rules.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{enumerate}
\item[ad 1 ] A-ILDICT is a set of quintuples
 
\( (skey, mkey, preference, meaning description, contextconditions) \)

The preference (an integer) and the meaning description are only relevant if
there is more than one mkey for the same skey. The mkey with
the highest preference value is the most plausible one. These
preferences can be derived from the order in which the meanings are
presented in a dictionary like Van Dale. They are added to the weak preference
bonus of the node that is labelled by the mkey.

The meaning description need not be a complete description of the
meaning, but it should discriminate clearly one particular meaning
of a word from other meanings of the same word. The information in Van Dale
N-E should be sufficient. The meaning description may be the empty string,
the only consequence is that in that case 
no interactive disambiguation is possible.

The context-conditions specify a set of skeys for each argument of
the mkey (it is only relevant if mkey is a function). 
This expresses that mkey is a meaning of skey only if skey is applied
to an argument with an skey from this set as its head. (Cf. the  section
on semi-idioms.) 

It is also indicated whether the context-condition
is a preference condition, which indicates that the mkey is always a possible
interpretation of the skeys, but that it is more plausible if the condition
holds,
or a `strong' condition, which forbids this interpretation if it does not hold.
\bigskip

The context-conditions have roughly the following form:

(the notation is a special case of the notation for the context-conditions
in IL-TEST)

1: KIND-OF-CONDITION, STRONGNESS, CONDITION-SET

...

...

n: KIND-OF-CONDITION, STRONGNESS, CONDITION-SET

(n is the number of arguments of the mkey)

Here KIND-OF-CONDITION may be {\sl key-condition}  or {\sl no-condition}.

STRONGNESS may be {\sl weak} or {\sl strong}.

The CONDITION-SET is a set of skeys.

In case of {\sl no-condition} both STRONGNESS and CONDITION-SET are irrelevant.


\item[ad 2] A-RULETRANSFER is a function from M-rules to sets of 
meaning rules, including parameters. In contrast with the Rosetta2 dogma,
it is now allowed that a syntactic rule has more than one meaning.
A-RULETRANSFER can in principle be specified by enumeration, in the
form of a table, but for rules with parameters the notation must also
provide the possibility to translate the parameters `locally'.

Example: 

assume that M-rule R1 has two parameters: parameter P1, with possible values
a1, a2, a3, parameter P2 with possible values b1, b2.

If the translation into IL depends in a complicated way from the parameters,
we can enumerate all possibilities, as follows:

R1 (a1, b1) \(\rightarrow\) M3 

R1 (a1, b2) \(\rightarrow\) M4(c1)    

R1 (a2, b1) \(\rightarrow\) M5(c2, d1)  

etc.

(assuming that M3 has no parameters, M4 has one parameter, M5 has two
parameters)

It may occur that several rules have the same parameter values and
that they are mapped in a systematic way onto parameter values of IL rules.
Then we may define a parameter transfer function,
e.g.:

PAR-TRANSFER(P1) \(=_{def}\) 

 a1 \(\rightarrow\) c1

 a2 \(\rightarrow\) c2

 a3 \(\rightarrow\) c3

The transfer of an M-rule can then be defined in a compact way:

R3 (P1, P2) \(\rightarrow\) M6 (PAR-TRANSFER(P1), PAR-TRANSFER(P2)) 

\end{enumerate}

It may be useful to specify explicitly the transfer of subgrammars (from
a theoretical point of view this is redundant, because each rule
belongs to a unique subgrammar). The usefulness depends on the representation
of derivation trees as supertrees or hypertrees and on the may M-GENERATOR
is applied. Therefore we leave this decision to the implementor.


The application of the context-conditions runs roughly as follows.
A-TRANSFER is applied top-down to a syntactic derivation tree.
When a variable-substitution rule is met, the set of head-skeys (usually one,
but more than one in case of coordinate constructs and the empty set
for expressions without a head) 
of the substituent is associated with all occurrences of the variable.
It is possible that the head of the substituent is itself a variable (e.g.
in placeholder substitution rules). Then the set of head-skeys
associated with the variable is considered as the set of head-skeys
of the substituent. 

If A-TRANSFER arrives at a function-application rule (in general one of the 
startrules), it will check the compatibility between the sets of head-skeys
associated with the argument-variables and the required skeys as indicated
in the context-conditions of the function (compatibility means that the
actual head-skeys are a subset of the required head-skeys).

If a strong condition holds, then spb := spb + 1.

If a strong condition does not hold, then cb := cb - 1.

If a weak condition holds, then wpb := wpb + 1.

If a strong condition holds, then wpb := wpb - 1.

\end{tabbing}
A-TRANSFER has two parameters, a syntactic derivation tree d and a set V 
consisting of two-tuples $<i, H>$, where i is the index of a variable occurring
in d and H is the set of head-skeys associated with this variable (we assume 
that each variable has a unique index). At the first call of A-TRANSFER V is 
empty. If A-TRANSFER arrives at a variable substitution rule a tuple consisting
of the index of the corresponding variable and of the set of head skeys is
added to V. In this way the head-skeys associated with the argument-variables 
are known when A-TRANSFER meets a function-application rule.

The parameters of the HEADKEYS function are the substituent derivation tree, 
the index of the variable and the set V which contains all variable indices
and associated head keys that have their defining occurrence at a higher level
in the derivation tree. This is necessary because the substituent of the 
variable substitution rule might be
a variable itself ( e.g. place-holder substitution rules). In that case
V contains the tuple containing the index of that variable plus the set of
its head keys.

A straightforward implementation of the A-TRANSFER function in which all
semantic derivation trees are explicitly created will certainly
cause a combinatorial explosion. This explosion can probably be avoided
if we make use of a more efficient representation for the resulting a set of
derivation trees: the so-called super-tree representation. This seems possible 
because there are no context checks between the different 
parts of the semantic derivation tree during A-TRANSFER. It is a prerequisite 
for the super-tree
approach, however, that it is not necessary to calculate at this point the 
total bonus for each semantic derivation tree. Apart from that, the super-tree 
trick only gives solace if the result of M-PARSER for one sentence is
not highly ambiguous, otherwise we will still have severe efficiency problems.


\subsection{IL-TEST}

During IL-TEST the dictionary ILLEX is used.

An entry of ILLEX has the form:

\( (mkey, nrargs, features, context-conditions) \)

ILLEX has an entry for each mkey. It specifies in the first place 
the `logical type'. For the moment it appears to be sufficient
to know whether the mkey denotes a function and if it is a function what the
number of arguments is. This can be implemented by means of one integer, 
{\sl nrargs}, which
is 0 for a constant and which is 1, 2 or 3 for functions.

In the second place semantic information about the kind of object or activity
denoted by the mkey may be given, in the form of a sort or a set of
semantic features. We will assume here that we choose for semantic features.
 
In the third place - and only for functions - context-conditions 
can be specified,
concerning the arguments. They may be formulated in terms of features or
features or in terms of mkeys. It is also indicated whether the condition
is a preference condition, which merely orders interpretations,
or a `strong' condition, which forbids certain interpretations.


The conditions on arguments will have roughly the following form:

1: KIND-OF-CONDITION, STRONGNESS, CONDITION-SET

...

...

n: KIND-OF-CONDITION, STRONGNESS, CONDITION-SET

(n is the number of arguments of the mkey)

Here KIND-OF-CONDITION may be:

{\sl feature-condition},

{\sl key-condition},

or {\sl no-condition}.

STRONGNESS may be {\sl weak} or {\sl strong}.

CONDITION-SET may be: 

in case of {\sl feature-condition}: a set of features,

in case of {\sl key-condition}: a set of mkeys.

In case of {\sl no-condition} both STRONGNESS and CONDITION-SET are irrelevant.

\bigskip

The compatibility tests are done in a similar way as in A-TRANSFER.
In the case of a feature-condition it is checked whether the features of the
actual arguments are a subset of the expected feature-sets.

For the moment we assume that the feature-sets are complete, but later
redundancy rules (e.g. MAN \( \rightarrow \) 
may be added in order to reduce the actual sets of features
in the lexicons.

The biggest problem that we will encounter during the implementation of
the IL-TEST module is the combinatorial explosion problem. A small
example shows that the problem will already occur in rather normal sentences.
A sentence with 10 translation relevant words that all have 3 IL- translations
will have $3^{10} = 59049$ corresponding IL-trees. A straightforward 
implementation in which each of these trees is created and/or tested seems to be 
doomed to failure. The solution to this problem is not obvious and will 
certainly require intensive study. For similar problems in artificial
intelligence and theorem proving in which there are many possible paths to a 
solution {\em heuristic } techniques are used. Maybe, in this case too, 
heuristic is the correct answer.

\subsection{G-TRANSFER}

The generative transfer function G-TRANSFER 
from semantic derivation trees to sets of 
ssyntactic derivation trees is defined by 
specification of:

\begin{enumerate}
\item the dictionary G-ILDICT.
A-ILDICT is a set of quadruples 
(mkey, skey, preference, contextcondition).

The preference is only relevant if
there is more than one skey for the same mkey. The skey with
the highest preference value indicates the `best word' corresponding
to meaning mkey. The
preferences can be derived from the order in which the translations 
corresponding to the same meaning are
presented in a dictionary like Van Dale N-E.

The context-condition is similar to that in A-TRANSFER. It
is only applicable to functions and it consists of a 
set of skeys for each argument of
the function denoted by mkey.
It expresses that mkey is a meaning of skey only if skey is applied
to an argument with an skey from this set as its head. 

\item a function G-RULETRANSFER from meaning-rules to sets of 
M-rules, including parameters. 
Notational conventions can be the same as in A-TRANSFER.

The definition is similar to that of A-TRANSFER.


\end{enumerate}
Because G-TRANSFER has compatibility checks on the resulting syntactic trees,
we again have effiency problems in the implementation. The severeness of this 
problem will 
especially depend on the ambiguity of the translation of mkeys. If the
translation of mkeys causes a combinatorial explosion we must consider
a non-conventional (e.g. a heuristic) approach for this module too.



\section{Semi-idioms}

Semi-idioms are expressions like "een voordracht houden", "een opmerking
maken". These expressions consist of a verb with a rather general meaning
and a specific argument of the verb, more precisely: an argument with a specific
head. This head, however, can be modified in many possible ways ("een
goede voordracht houden") and relative constructions are allowed 
("de opmerking die zij maakte"). 
Therefore it is not possible to treat these expressions as
ordinary flexible idioms. On the other hand this is not necessary either;
semi-idioms have a more or less compositional semantics, the translation
of the argument can be done locally, but the
translation of the verb depends strongly on the head of the argument.
(Cf. Andr\'{e} Schenk, forthcoming; the approach described here has been chosen
in consultation with Andr\'{e}.)

Semi-idioms are handled by making use of both the context-condition
in IL-DICT and the context-condition on IL-LEX.
E.g. "een voordracht houden":

In A-ILDICT 
SKhouden is related to the meaning key MKhouden2 with a strong 
context-condition on the second argument:

2: {\sl key-condition, strong,}, {SKvoordracht, SKlezing} 

MKhouden2 has a strong context-condition on the meaning keys of the 
second argument,
in ILLEX. This condition prevents that MKhouden2 is applied to the wrong 
meaning of `voordracht' (e.g. `nomination').

If this is more convenient, the key-condition for MKhouden2 can be 
replaced by a feature-condition. 


\section{Overview of information needed for transfer}

A-ILDICT (called \(A-TR_{B}\) in R0011)

G-ILDICT (called \(G-TR_{B}\) in R0011)

ILLEX

A-RULETRANSFER (called \(A-TR_{R}\) in R0011)

G-RULETRANSFER (called \(G-TR_{R}\) in R0011)

Specification of the rules for function-application.

Specification of the rules for variable-substitution.

Specification of the head arguments of both syntactic and semantic
rules (needed for semi-idioms and preference tests). 
This is trivial in most cases: the head is always the first argument
except for coordination rules.
