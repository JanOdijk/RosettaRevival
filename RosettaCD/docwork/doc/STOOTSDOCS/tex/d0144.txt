\section{Longman's grammatical codes for verbs}

In this document I will discuss whether it is possible to use the grammatical 
codes that are assigned to verbs in the {\em Longman Dictionary of Contemporary 
English} (1982), for assigning values to the attributes thetavp and synvps (
expressing the verbpatterns) in the dictionary for Rosetta3. I will do this by 
taking each code that exists in Longman for verbs and give the values for 
thetavp and synvps that correspond to these codes.

The codes in Longman consist of capitals, numbers and optionally small letters. 
The capitals give a subdivision into types of verbs:
\begin{description}
  \item [I] intransitive verbs
  \item [L] linking verbs
  \item [T] transitive verbs
  \item [D] ditransitive verbs
  \item [V] verbs + object + verb form
  \item [X] verbs + object + object complement
\end{description}
The numbers refer to the categorial realization of the complements of the verbs
:
\begin{description}
  \item [$\emptyset$] nothing need follow the verb
  \item [1] the verb is followed by a (or more) nounlike expression(s)
  \item [2] the verb is followed by an infinitive without {\em to}
  \item [3] the verb is followed by an infinitive with {\em to}
  \item [4] the verb is followed by an {\em -ing} form
  \item [5] the verb is followed by {\em that} + a clause
  \item [6] the verb is followed by a {\em wh}-word, {\em how} or {\em as if}
+ either a cluase or a phrase
  \item [7] the verb is followed by an adjective
  \item [8] the verb is followed by a past participle
  \item [9] the verb is followed by an adverbial
\end{description}
Optionally, small letters may appear inside the grammatical codes. {\em a }
may be combined with 5; 5a means: {\em that} may be deleted. {\em a } can also 
be combined with 6; 6a means: the {\em wh}-word is followed by a clause. {\em  
b} means in combination with 5: the verb may be followed by {\em so}:
{\em I told you so}. 6b means: the {\em wh}-word is followed by a phrase. The 
last possibility is 5c, meaning that the subordinate clause may be used in the 
subjunctive. The small letters in combination with 5 give information that can 
be relevant in Rosetta, although this information will generally not be spelled 
out in 
the verbpatterns. The letters in combination with 6 are not very interesting, 
because the difference between phrase and clause is not very clear and need not 
be made in that way in Rosetta. In this document I only give the relation 
between the Longman codes and the attributes thetavp and synvps. The 
information expressed in these numbers should be expressed in other 
verbpatterns. 

The comparison of the Longman codes with the Rosetta3 attributes for 
verbpatterns leads to the conclusion that it is profitable to use these codes 
in the dictionary work for Rosetta3. Jan Odijk has helped me out at several 
points in establishing the relation between the Longman and the Rosetta3 
dictionary.

The values for the attribute {\em thetavp} are as given in my document 108
("Verbpatterns in Rosetta3"): vp000, vp100, vp010, vp120, vp012 and vp123. The 
values for the attriubte {\em synvps} (cf. also document 108) are all prefixed 
by {\em syn} to prevent names of categories used elsewhere to be used as values 
in this attribute. If there are two arguments inside the VERBP, the names of 
the categories in {\em synvps} are separated by \_.


\section{Relation between Longman's codes and Rosetta3 verbpatterns}

In this section I will give the values for the attributes used in Rosetta3
to express the verbpatterns (in terms of the attributes thetavp and synvps) for 
each code used for verbs
in Longman. For each code it is indicated how often it has been assigned to
a verb in Longman's dictionary. This information has been taken from
Akkerman ("A Critical Assessment of the LDOCE Coding System", draft English 
Department - Amsterdam, 1986).

\subsection{Intransitive verbs}

\begin{enumerate}
 \item "Weather" verbs.
 \begin{description}
   \item [{[it + I$\emptyset$]}] The number of verbs with this code is not given
         in Akkerman (1986).
   \item [thetavp and synvps] vp000 and [\ ].
 \end{description}
 \item Intransitive verbs that require no complement.
 \begin{description}
   \item [{[I$\emptyset$]}] (3420!)
   \item [thetavp and synvps] There are several possibilities:
     \begin{itemize}
       \item thetavp = vp100 and synvps = [\ ]. For intransitive verbs as in:
{\em John sleeps}.
       \item Intransitive verbs with a particle ({\em wake up}) may be coded in 
Longman as
v adv or as v only, in which case the particle is mentioned in the grammatical 
code in capitals ([I$\emptyset$: (UP)]). In such a case thetavp = vp100 and 
synvps = [\ ], just as above, but the attribute for the particle should receive 
the value corresponding to the particle.
       \item thetavp = vp010 and synvps = [synNP]. For ergative verbs as in:
{\em The ice melts}.
       \item thetavp = vp120 and synvps = [synEMPTY]. For verbs with deletable
objects as in: {\em John eats}.
       \item thetavp = vp120 and synvps = [synPROSENT]. For verbs such as 
{\em wonder} in {\em I wonder}.
       \item If [I$\emptyset$ ({\em to/with} and/or {\em about})]: {\em talk to 
someone about something}. Thetavp = vp123 and synvps = [synTONP\_PREPNP]. It 
may be that this kind of construction occurs with other Longman codes as well. 
These cases need to be checked by hand. Other verbs may need the value 
[synPREPNP\_PREPNP]. Only for the preposition {\em to} the PREPNP will be
TONP.
       \item Directional verbs such as {\em go away} and {\em jump off the 
building} also get this code in Longman. For these verbs thetavp = vp120 and 
synvps = [synDIROPENPREPPPROP]. DIROPENPREPPPROP means directional PP. 
       \item It is not entirely clear if English also has directional dyadic 
ergative verbs. An example from Dutch: {\em De auto reed de garage in.} If 
verbs like this exist in English, thetavp should be vp012 and synvps = 
[synNP\_DIROPENPREPPPROP].
     \end{itemize}
 \end{description}
This code is problematic, because there is a large number of verbs with this
code in Longman's dictionary and they should be further distinguished for
Rosetta3. This can only be done by hand.
\item Intransitive verbs + infinitive without {\em to}.
\begin{description}
  \item [{[I2]}] (12) These verbs are the modal auxiliaries and {\em do}.
        {\em Do} doesn't need a verbpattern in Rosetta3 and the modals
        get both combinations of values listed below.
  \item [thetavp and synvps] There are two combinations of values:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item thetavp = vp120 and synvps = [synOPENINFSENT]
      \item thetavp = vp010 and synvps = [synCLOSEDINFSENT]
    \end{itemize}
\end{description}
\item Intransitive verbs + {\em to}-infinitive.
 \begin{description}
   \item [{[I3]}] (79) With these verbs, the {\em to}-infinitive is often 
optional and functioning as an adverbial: {\em He awoke to find himself famous.}
However, the ASCOT report no 1 ("Designing a Computerized Lexicon for 
Linguistic Purposes", Akkerman, Masereeuw and Meijs - Amsterdam: Rodopi, 1985)
notices that this code also covers some verbs 
where the adjunct is obligatory: {\em He was aching to go}. The code also 
covers {\em used (to)} and {\em ought} to. These could be analyzed as modals,
cf. above. {\em Seem} and {\em appear} also receive this code.
   \item [thetavp and synvps] There are several possibilities:
     \begin{itemize}
       \item If [I$\emptyset$,3], thetavp = vp100 and synvps = [\ ]. For 
intransitive verbs with optional adverbial: {\em He awoke to find himself 
famous}.
       \item If [I3], thetavp = vp120 and synvps = [synOPENTOSENT]. For verbs 
with 
an obligatory adjunct: {\em He was aching to go}. This coding and the coding 
for the verbs above seem to be correct as a first guess. Still, it should be 
checked by hand as well.
       \item If {\em used (to)} or {\em ought (to)}, as with [I2].
       \item If {\em seem} or {\em appear}, thetavp = vp010 and synvps = 
[synCLOSEDTOSENT].
   \end{itemize}
For this code, as few verbs need a separate treatment. With respect to the
other verbs, a difference must be made between verbs with an optional and verbs 
with an obligatory {\em to}-infinitive.
 \end{description}
 \item Intransitive verbs + {\em ing}-phrase.
 \begin{description}
  \item [{[I4]}] (9) The same observations apply as for [I3].
  \item [thetavp and synvps] There are several possibilities.
   \begin{itemize}
    \item If [I$\emptyset$,4], thetavp = vp100 and synvps = [\ ]: {\em He wrote 
asking me to come}.
    \item If [I4], thetavp = vp120 and synvps = [synOPENGERUND]: {\em He burst 
out 
singing}. ({\em burst out}) is v adv.This coding and the one above should 
nevertheless be checked by hand.
    \item If {\em be} as auxiliary of the progressive, no verbpattern.
   \end{itemize}
  \end{description}
 \item Intransitive verbs + {\em that}-clause.
  \begin{description}
   \item [{[I5]}] (10) These verbs are either verbs with two arguments, one of
them realized as a {\em that}-clause ({\em They voted that the school should
continue}) or verbs with one argument, realized as a {\em that}-clause ({\em it
appears that she will win}).
   \item [thetavp and synvps] There are two possibilities:
     \begin{itemize}
       \item thetavp = vp120 and synvps = [synTHATSENT]. These values are for:
{\em grizzle}, {\em vote}, {\em wail} and {\em write back}.
       \item thetavp = vp010 and synvps = [synTHATSENT]. These values are for:
{\em appear}, {\em chance}, {\em happen}, {\em seem}, {\em transpire}, {\em 
come about}.
    \item for {\em seem} and {\em appear} as well: thetavp = vp012 and synvps = 
[synIONP\_THATSENT]. For these verbs it might also be better to give them 
thetavp = vp012 and for the case where the indirect object is not realized,
synvps = [synEMPTY\_THATSENT].
     \end{itemize}
  \end{description}
 \item Intransitive verbs + {\em wh}-word, {\em how}, or {\em as if} + either a 
clause or a phrase.
  \begin{description}
   \item [{[I6]}] (2) This code is for {\em appear} and {\em seem} in sentences 
like {\em It appears as if she will win}.
   \item [thetavp and synvps] thetavp = vp010 and synvps = 
[synASIFCLOSEDADJPPROP].
The value for synvps is a provisional name. In general, code 6 should be 
further subdivided into {\em as if}-phrases and the rest. The name of synvps 
suggests that these phrases should be analyzed as an ADJPPROP with an abstract
(finally empty) ADJ as
head. The ASIF prefix is added to be able to distinguish this one from other 
ADJPPROPs.
  \end{description}
 \item Intransitive verbs + past participle.
  \begin{description}
   \item [{[I8]}] (2) This code is used for {\em be} as passive auxiliary and 
{\em have} as auxiliary of the perfect.
   \item [thetavp and synvps] No verbpatterns for these verbs.
  \end{description}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Linking verbs}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Copula + nominal object complement.
   \begin{description}
    \item [{[L(to be)1]}] (65) This code is for verbs in sentences such as: 
{\em She became President}, {\em She became what she wanted to be}. Quirk gives 
a much smaller list for this kind of verbs, however. It may be that this code 
contains verbs that should be analyzed as transitive verbs. Furthermore, it 
contains verbs that take "measure phrases".
    \item [thetavp and synvps] There are several cases:
      \begin{itemize}
       \item For [L1] there are three possibilities: thetavp = vp010 and 
synvps = [synCLOSEDNPPROP] (for {\em become} in {\em She became President}).
For verbs that should be analyzed as transitives, thetavp = vp120 and synvps =
[synNP]. For verbs which take a measure phrase ({\em This costs \$6}), thetavp
 = 
vp120 and synvps could be given the value [synMEASUREPHRASE], leaving the exact 
analysis of measure phrases for the future. Jan Odijk suggested to treat 
measure phrases as [synOPENNPPROP]. {\em Cost} also allows an indirect object: 
{\em This cost me \$6}. In that case thetavp = vp123 and synvps = [synIONP\_
MEASUREPHRASE]. If both constructions are allowed (as with {\em cost}), 
thetavp might have to be vp123 in both cases and synvps = [synEMPTY\_
MEASUREPHRASE, synIONP\_MEASUREPHRASE].
       \item If [L(to be)1]: thetavp = vp010 and synvps = [synCLOSEDTOSENT,
synCLOSEDNPPROP].]
      \end{itemize}
   \end{description}
  \item Linking verbs + {\em to}-infinitive.
   \begin{description}
    \item [{[L3]}] (3) This code is used for 3 verbs: {\em be} ({\em The 
difficulty is to know what to do}), {\em incline} ({\em I incline to take the 
opposite view}) and {\em turn out} 
({\em His statement turned out to be false}).
    \item [thetavp and synvps] For these 3 verbs:
     \begin{itemize}
      \item For {\em be}: no verbpattern. These sentences are handled by the 
identificational subgrammar.
      \item For {\em incline}: thetavp = vp120 and synvps = [synOPENTOSENT].
(subject controller)
      \item For {\em turn out}: thetavp = vp010 and synvps = [synCLOSEDTOSENT].
     \end{itemize}
   \end{description}
  \item Linking verbs + {\em ing}-form.
    \begin{description}
     \item [{[L4]}] (4) This code is used for {\em be} ({\em The trouble is 
knowing what to do}), {\em come across as} ({\em He came across as (being) 
quite a nice person}), {\em end up} ({\em She ended up dancing on the table})
and {\em wind up} ({\em He wound up feeling ashamed of himself}).
     \item [thetavp and synvps] 
       \begin{itemize}
        \item For {\em be}, no verbpattern is necessary. This construction is 
handled in the identificational subgrammar.
        \item For the other verbs\footnote{Note that {\em end up} and 
{\em wind up} present a translation problem. Translations for the sentences 
above could be : {\em Ze danste uiteindelijk op de tafel} and {\em Hij schaamde 
zich op het laatst}.}: thetavp = vp120 and synvps = [synOPENGERUND].
        \item For {\em come across as a nice person}: verbal category = v adv,
thetavp = vp120 and synvps = [synPREPOPENNPPROP]
       \end{itemize}
   \end{description}
  \item Linking verbs + {\em that}-clause.
   \begin{description}
    \item [{[L5]}] (2) This code is for {\em be} ({\em The answer is that we 
don't want to stay in}) and for {\em go} 
({\em The story goes that he is ill }).
    \item [thetavp and synvps] The two verbs should be analyzed as follows:
     \begin{itemize}
      \item {\em Be}: no verbpattern, this construction is handled by the 
identificational subgrammar.
      \item {\em Go}: thetavp = vp120 and synvps = [synTHATSENT]. However, it 
may be the case that this use of {\em go} should be handled as an idiom.
     \end{itemize}
With number 5 there is a further coding: 5a and 5b. 5a means that {\em that} 
may be left out and 5b means that the {\em that}-clause can be replaced by 
{\em so}. In case of 5a, an attribute is needed for verbs in English that 
indicates that {\em that} can be left out. In case of 5b, synvps should not 
only be [synTHATSENT], but also [synSOPROSENT].
   \end{description}
 \item Linking verb + {\em wh}-word, {\em how}, {\em as if} + clause or phrase
.
  \begin{description}
   \item [{[L6]}] (1) This code is used for {\em be} in {\em It is as if we had 
never even started}.
   \item [thetavp and synvps] No verbpattern for this use of {\em be}.
  \end{description}
 \item Linking verbs + adjective.
  \begin{description}
   \item [{[L(to be)7]}] (55) This code is used for verbs which take one 
argument. The same observations apply as with [L1].
   \item [thetavp and synvps] There are two possibilities:
    \begin{itemize}
     \item If [L7]: thetavp = vp010 and synvps = [synCLOSEDADJPPROP], for
{\em He seems ill},
           or: thetavp = vp120 and synvps =[synOPENADJPPROP], for {\em This book 
smells old}.
     \item If [L(to be)7]: thetavp = vp010 and synvps = [synCLOSEDTOSENT,
synCLOSEDADJPPROP]. This coding seems to be a good approximation. The verbs 
should still be checked by hand, however.
    \end{itemize}
  \end{description}
 \item Linking verb + past participle.
  \begin{description}
   \item [{[L8]}] (1) This code is for {\em get} in {\em He got trapped}.
   \item [thetavp and synvps] thetavp = vp010 and synvps = [synCLOSEDVERBPPROP].
For {\em get} in {\em He got her trapped}, thetavp=vp120 and synvps =
[synCLOSEDVERBPPROP]. Note that in these constructions, the verb should always 
have passive morphology. Either there should be a separate attribute on the verb
that indicates this, or the verbpattern-rule should spell this out. In the last 
case there should be a separate value of synvps for these cases (e.g. 
[synCLOSEDPASSVERBPPROP].
  \end{description}
 \item Linking verbs + adverbial.
  \begin{description}
   \item [{[L9]}] (564!) According to the ASCOT report only 10 verbs in this 
class can be classified as copulas: {\em be, get, keep, live, come, go, remain,
stay, stand} and {\em lie}. For the other verbs, the adverbial is obligatory
(or probably so) and can be analyzed as having two arguments.
   \item [thetavp and synvps] Again there are two possibilities:
    \begin{itemize}
     \item For the 10 verbs mentioned above, thetavp = vp010 and synvps =
[synLOCCLOSEDPREPPPROP] or [synDIRCLOSEDPREPPPROP], or both.
     \item For the other verbs: thetavp = vp120 and synvps = 
[synDIROPENPREPPPROP]. The other verbs will probably be directional verbs, see
[I$\emptyset$] above. Perhaps synvps= [synLOCOPENPREPPPROP] is necessary as 
well. These verbs should be checked by hand.
    \end{itemize}
  \end{description}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Transitive verbs}

With the transitive verbs there is one misprint in the dictionary: [T$\emptyset
$], for the verb {\em pop}. This code can be deleted.

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Transitive verbs + nominal element.
   \begin{description}
    \item [{[T1]}] (6533!) This is by far the largest class of verbs.
    \item [thetavp and synvps] There are several possibilities:
      \begin{itemize}
        \item thetavp = vp120 and synvps = [synNP].
        \item If the category is v prep: thetavp = vp120 and synvps = 
[synPREPNP]. The attribute that indicates that the verb expects a preposition 
should receive a value as well. Often this preposition is indicated in the 
grammatical code in Longman.
        \item If the category is v adv: thetavp = vp120 and synvps = [synNP],
the attribute that indicates that the verb expects a particle should receive a 
value as well.
       \end{itemize}
   \end{description}
  \item Transitive verbs + infinitive without {\em to}.
   \begin{description}
    \item [{[T2]}] (4) There are only four verbs with this code. One of them,
{\em dare}, should be analyzed as modal (cf. [I2]). The other three ({\em come 
into, come out against, flick}) are incorrectly coded and should have been coded
[T1]. {\em Come into} should perhaps be regarded as an idiom.
    \item [thetavp and synvps] see above.
   \end{description}
 \item Transitive verbs + {\em to}-infinitive.
  \begin{description}
   \item [{[T3]}] (93) This code is for verbs which take a {\em to}-infinitive 
without subject.
   \item [thetavp and synvps] thetavp = vp120 and synvps = [synOPENTOSENT].
For some verbs synvps = [synFORTOSENT] should be added (e.g. {\em want} and 
{\em prefer}). A difference should be made between {\em decide}-type of verbs 
({\em it was decided to leave}) and {\em try}-type of verbs 
{\em (*it was tried to leave)}. This need not be expressed in the verbpattern, 
but should be expressed in another attribute.
  \end{description}
 \item Transitive verbs + {\em ing}-form.
  \begin{description}
   \item [{[T4]}] (222) This code is for verbs as in : {\em I enjoyed singing}.
   \item [thetavp and synvps] thetavp = vp120 and synvps = [synOPENGERUND].
If this code is assigned to verbs with category v prep, thetavp = vp120 and 
synvps = [synPREPCLOSEDGERUND]. ({\em You can't count on the weather being 
fine.}
  \end{description}
 \item Transitive verbs + {\em that}-clause
  \begin{description}
    \item [{[T5]}] (257) This code is for verbs as in {\em I know that he'll 
come}.
    \item [thetavp andd synvps] thetavp = vp120 and synvps = [synTHATSENT].
The same observations about code 5a and 5b apply as with [L5].
  \end{description}

 \item Transitive verbs + {\em wh}-word, {\em how}, {\em as if} + clause or 
phrase.
  \begin{description}
   \item [{[T6]}] (124) This code is for verbs as in {\em He decided who should 
go}
and {\em She considered when to go}.
   \item [thetavp and synvps] thetavp = vp120 and synvps = [synQSENT].
  \end{description}
 \end{enumerate}

\subsection{Ditransitive verbs}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Ditransitive verbs + nominal elements
   \begin{description}
    \item [{[D1]}] (454)  This code is for double object verbs.
    \item [thetavp and synvps] There are several possibilities:
      \begin{itemize}
       \item Longman does not contain separate codes for prepositional objects.
These verbs have a different category: v prep. If the prepositional variant is
possible with double object verbs, the preposition is indicated inside the 
code.
However, this coding appears to be not totally consistent, therefore, checking 
in 
individual cases is necessary. So, we have the following possibilities:
       \item If [D1]: thetavp = vp123 and synvps = [synIONP\_DONP] or sometimes
[EMPTY\_DONP]. {\em I gave her the book}, {\em I gave the book}.
       \item If [D1(to)] or [D1(for)]: thetavp = vp123 and synvps = 
[synDONP\_FORNP], [synDONP\_TONP] or [synIONP\_DONP]. {\em I gave the book to 
her}, {\em I bought a book for him}, {\em I gave her the book}, {\em I bought 
him a book}.
       \item If [D1] v prep: thetavp = vp123 and synvps = [synDONP\_PREPNP].  
The attribute for the preposition must receive a value.
       \item If [D1] v adv prep: thetavp = vp123 and synvps = 
[synDONP\_PREPNP]. The attribute for the particle should also receive a value.
       \item If [D1 + on/for]: thetavp = vp123 and synvps = [synDONP\_PREPNP] 
It cannot be predicted from this code , however, with which argument 
the prepostion should be combined. {\em to spread butter on bread}, {\em to 
spread bread with butter}. These verbs should be given separate entries. Note 
that they give different translations: {\em boter op brood {\em smeren}}, 
{\em brood met boter {\em besmeren}}. 
      \end{itemize}
   \end{description}
  \item Ditransitive verb + NP + {\em to}-infinitive.
    \begin{description}
     \item [{[D3]}] (1) This code is for {\em trust} as in: {\em You can't 
trust him to do anything right}.
     \item [thetavp and synvps] thetavp = vp123 and synvps = 
[synDONP\_OPENTOSENT].
The coding for these kinds of verbs is not very consistent in Longman. No 
difference is made between control verbs and exceptional case marking verbs. 
Most other verbs that occur in sentences as above have a V code (see next 
section).
    \end{description}
 \item Ditransitive verbs + NP + {\em that}-clause.
  \begin{description}
   \item [{[D5]}] (32) {\em He told me that he would be back early}.
   \item [thetavp and synvps] thetavp = vp123 and synvps = [synIONP\_THATSENT].
Note that for some verbs this should be [synPREPNP\_THATSENT]. It may be the 
case 
that Longman codes these verbs as v prep, but otherwise the right 
attribute-values should be added by hand. ({\em He mentioned to me that he 
would be back early}.)
  \end{description}
 \item Ditransitive verbs + {\em wh}-word, {\em how}, {\em as if} + clause or 
phrase.
  \begin{description}
   \item [{[D6]}] (13) {\em Tell me where to go}.
   \item [thetavp and synvps] thetavp = vp123 and synvps = [synIONP\_QSENT].
  \end{description}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Verbs with object plus verbform}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Verbs + NP + infinitive without {\em to}.
   \begin{description}
    \item [{[V2]}] (15) This code is for verbs as in: 
{\em I saw the man leave}.
    \item [thetavp and synvps] thetavp = vp120 and synvps = [synCLOSEDINFSENT].
This is the coding for perception and causative verbs. 
   \end{description}
  \item Verbs + NP + {\em to}-infinitive.
    \begin{description}
     \item [{[V3]}] (219) This code is for both control verbs and exceptional 
case marking verbs.
     \item [thetavp and synvps] There are two possibilities:
       \begin{itemize}
        \item thetavp = vp120 and synvps = [synCLOSEDTOSENT]. This is the 
coding 
for exceptional case marking verbs. {\em The officer expected his men to do 
their duty in the coming battle}
        \item thetavp = vp123 and synvps = [synIONP\_OPENTOSENT]. This is the 
coding 
for control verbs. This coding does not differentiate between subject and 
object controllers. {\em She promised him never to lie to him again} and
{\em Try to persuade him to let us go with him}
       \end{itemize}
    \end{description}
 \item Verbs + NP + {\em ing}-form.
   \begin{description}
    \item [{[V4]}] (102) This code is for verbs as in {\em He watched his 
mother cooking the dinner.}
    \item [thetavp and synvps] thetavp = vp120 and synvps = [synCLOSEDGERUND].
For some verbs it may be the case that thetavp should be vp120 and synvps =
[synNP]. In such cases, only the NP is the argument and the {\em ing}-form is a 
non-argument adverbial. This difference should be checked by hand.
   \end{description}
\item Verbs + NP + past participle
  \begin{description}
   \item [{[V8]}] (5) This code is for verbs as in {\em to have a house built.}
The five verbs are: {\em have, make, need, see, want}. Verbs such as {\em hear}
and {\em get} should also be analyzed in this way, although they do not have 
this code in Longman.
   \item [thetavp and synvps] thetavp = vp120 and synvps = [synCLOSEDVERBPPROP].
As with the verbs with code [L8], the verbs should always have passive 
morphology. This should be taken care of in the rules.
  \end{description}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Verbs with object and object complement}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Verbs + NP + NP-object complement
   \begin{description}
    \item [{[X(to be)1]}] (88) This code is for verbs such as {\em consider},
as in {\em They considered him a fool} and for verbs such as {\em elect}, as in
{\em They elected him President}.
    \item [thetavp and synvps] There are several possibilities:
     \begin{itemize}
      \item If [X1]: thetavp = vp120 and synvps = [synCLOSEDNPPROP] (for {\em  
consider}) or thetavp = vp123 and synvps = [synNP\_OPENNPPROP] (for 
{\em elect}).
      \item If [X(to be)1]: thetavp = vp120 and synvps = [synCLOSEDTOSENT,
synCLOSEDNPPROP].
      \item If [X1] v prep: thetavp = vp120 and synvps = [synCLOSEDNPPROP].
The attribute for the preposition should receive a value. The preposition will 
be introduced syncategorematically. {\em They regarded him as a fool.}
     \end{itemize}
   \end{description}
  \item Verbs + NP + adjectival object complement
   \begin{description}
    \item [{[X(to be)7]}] (122) This code is for verbs such as {\em paint} in 
{\em He painted the door blue.}
    \item [thetavp and synvps] There are several possibilities:
      \begin{itemize}
       \item If [X7]: thetavp = vp120 and synvps = [synCLOSEDADJPPROP] (for 
{\em  I consider him foolish}) or thetavp = vp123 and synvps = 
[synNP\_OPENADJPPROP] (for{\em He painted the door blue}).
       \item If [X(to be)7]: thetavp = vp120 and synvps = [synCLOSEDTOSENT,
synCLOSEDADJPPROP].
      \end{itemize}
   \end{description}
 \item Verbs + NP + adverbial
   \begin{description}
    \item [{[X9]}] (477!) This code is for verbs such as {\em put} in {\em Put
your coat in the cupboard.} There is a large number of verbs with this code. I 
do not think that with all these verbs the adverbial should be regarded as an
argument. It must be checked by hand if the adverbial is obligatory with such a 
verb (in the particular meaning it has in such sentences).
    \item [thetavp and synvps] thetavp = vp123 and synvps = 
[synDONP\_LOCOPENPREPPPROP] or [synDONP\_DIROPENPREPPPROP] ({\em He drove the
car into the garage}).
   \end{description}
\end{enumerate}

\section{Tables}

These tables contain the information from the body of the text. They do not 
refer to information that is contained in the Longman codes which is not 
expressed in thetavp and synvps (such as the meaning of the codes 5a and 5c, 
see section 1) or the attributes for particle and preposition (cf. section 2). 
A separate note will appear containing a list of all the attribute values for 
synvps for English. It may contain values that have not been found within the 
Longman dictionary.
