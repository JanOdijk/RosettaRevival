$ TRANSLATION OF TIME$



$ _0. Introduction_$

$ The aim of this note is to give an introduction to the problem of translating
"time" in natural languages and an impuls to a proposal for the treatment of
time in Rosetta. The character of this note will be informal therefore.$

$ Translation of time in natural languages does not seem to be a simple mapping
of the "tenses" that exist in these languages. Other factors that also express
some time aspect complicate such a simple translation.$

$ I will first sketch the problem of translating time concepts in
natural languages in general (1). Then I will give a short summary and
evaluation of
the solution that was chosen in Rosetta2 (2). In 3 I will mention shortly
a slightly different approach to the formalism that was used to represent the
time expressions in Rosetta2. In 4, I will discuss a possible first approach
to translate time expressions in new Rosetta versions in a more fundamental way
by using the time theory of Reichenbach (1947). Finally, in 5, some remaining
problems and possible directions for finding solutions to them will be dealt
with.$

$NP
$ _1. The problem of translating "time"_$

$ I will restrict myself in this note to the problem of time reference of
sentences
(in texts) leaving open the question if other "phrases" also have a time
reference. I will also ignore here the notion of frequency that is related to
time and any interaction with modality.$

_1.1 Time_

$ All linguistic theories about time are based on the following assumptions:$
$ (i) There exists some model of time that is represented as a set of time 
points
which
is ordered with a relation "<" meaning "earlier than". A subset of this 
set is called an interval and has duration, while a time point usually is
considered to have no duration.$
$ (ii) A sentence describes an event that is placed in time (it has a time
reference) with respect to the
moment of speech (utterance, writing) (indirectly). This point of speech (S) is
mostly considered to be a time point.$
$ So time deals with points, intervals and the relations among them in a
time model.$

$ The expressions and means that reflect some aspect of time in natural
language are varied:$

_a) Tense or tempus_:
$ This is, generally speaking, a linguistic category that consists of
morphological forms of the verb or morphological forms of "auxiliary verbs" in
combination with particular morphological forms of the "main verb" (these are
also called periphrastic forms). However, it is not always clear what counts as
an auxiliary verb in languages. In general, tense gives information about time
reference of the event that is expressed by a sentence, but sometimes about
"aspect" as well (see below) to which distinction attention is often paid only
when it is a morphological distinction in the verb paradigm of particular
languages.$
_b) Time adverbials_:
$ These are time adverbs, PP's and conjunctions. They specify a certain time
reference. They can be divided into two classes:$
$ (i) adverbials that answer the question: "when?"$
$ (ii) adverbials that answer the question: "how long?" or "in how much time?"$
$ The first class can be divided into two subclasses:$
$ 1) adverbials that specify a certain time reference in relation to the
point of speech (e.g. "yesterday", "tomorrrow", "now" etc.)$
$ 2) adverbials that specify a time reference in relation to the point of
speech in combination with other temporal expressions (e.g. "on tuesday", "in
the summer", "with Christmas" etc.).$
$ Compare: "He came on tuesday" and "He is coming on tuesday".$
$ The second class consists of the duration adverbials that specify the length
of the
event or the period in which the event is realized. This class is somtimes
called the class of "aspectual time adverbials" (e.g. "3 uur", "in 3 uur",
"enkele
weken", "een paar uur") (cf. Dowty(1979), Verkuyl(1972)).$
_c) "Consecutio temporum"_ :
$ Events can have a time relation to each other. If both events have tense and
both have a certain relation to the point of speech, then they
have "compatible" tenses to express that relation to S.$
example: hij zei, dat hij kwam (*komt)
         hij zei, dat hij was gekomen (*is gekomen)
         terwijl hij in de tuin werkte, kwam (*komt) Marie binnen
$ The particular choices of these "compatible tenses" express the time relation
between the events in question.$
$ Consecutio temporum does not only work within a sentence, it also exists over
different sentences in a text or discourse. Using certain tenses in subsequent
sentences can give information about the relation between the events described
by these sentences.$
example: _o.v.t._ vs. _v.t.t._ in Dutch
$ Using an _o.v.t._ in a text gives a strong impression of subsequent events in
the past,
while
using a _v.t.t._ does not say anything about an ordering of the events in the
past.$

$ The aspects of time that play a role in the determination of the "time of a
sentence" are varied too:$

_a) Time reference:_
$ This is the placing of the event in the time model. There are always two
points
that must be expressed in the time model:$
S: moment of speech
E: moment or interval of event
For this moment or interval E the event is (was, will be) true.
$ Time reference expresses the relation between S and E. This is not always
done directly (absolute time reference), but sometimes indirectly with (an)
intermediate point(s) or interval(s) R (relative time reference).$

$ A _time model_ can be seen as a pair < T,_<_ >, where T is a set of time
points t
and "_<_" a relation "earlier than" between elements of T.$
$ A set V such that for each x and y in V, x _<_ y or y _<_ x is called a
"_chain_". V is also said to be "linearly" or "simply ordered"; it has no
"branches".$
$ An _interval_ I _C_ T is a chain
such
that for each x <= T, if there exist y, z <= I such that y _<_ x and x _<_ z
and if {x} U I is a chain then x <= I.$
$ X%i% is a _relation_ between intervals I%i% and I%i+1%. X could be
defined as "before", "after", "simultaneous with", "contains", "overlaps",
"is overlapped by".$
$ ("_C_" is "subset of", "U" is "union of" and "<=" is
"element of".)$
$ A _time reference_ now can be expressed by the following formula:$
                  n - 1
                   /\    X%i%(I%i%,I%i+1%)
                  i = 1
I%1% is the time of speech(S)
I%n% is the time of event(E)
I%i% with i = 2,3,....,n - 1 is a time of reference(R)
$ This definition of time reference of an event expressed by a sentence in
natural languages that comes from Bruce (1972) seems to be too wide. It seems
that n has a maximum and that the instances of X and the sequence of particular
X%i%'s are restricted.$
Example:
Suppose n = 3 and X%1% = X%2% = X%3% = "before".
Then the time reference of E is:
                S before R%1% %^% R%1% before R%2% %^% R%2% before E

                ------|-------|-----------|------|--------------->
                      S       R%1%          R%2%       E

$ I do not know how to express this in natural language within a simple
sentence without
context. However, it is imaginable that this representation is the time
reference of the last sentence of the following fragment:$

$ "Jan komt morgen (R%1%). Hij zal dan zeggen hoe laat Marietje komt (R%2%).
Jullie beginnen dan meteen daarna met het inwerken (E)."$

or of the last clause in the following complex sentence:

$ "Als Jan morgen komt (R%1%), zal hij zeggen wanneer Marietje zal laten weten
(R%2%) hoe laat ze ons verwacht (E)."$

$ Note that within a clause the number of reference points is always limited
and that R%1% and R%2% in the example above are the time references of other
events.$
$ The relation between S, R and E is most often expressed by tense. S, R, E or
their
relation to each other can be specified by adverbials and/or tense (e.g.
duration, stress,
distance, beginning, end, frequency etc.)$

$ _b) Aspect_:$
(i) _Perfectivity_
$ The time model provides us with points and intervals. Points do not have
any duration, whereas intervals do. But there seems to be another phenomenon in
language: it is possible to change the unit of the time model (the point in
the model above) to larger units that can have duration but that are considered
as
primitives, not "accessible" in the sense that a subinterval can be
considered, although this would be possible in principle (cf. De Vuyst (1983)).
This flexibility of the time model is used for example to express the contrast
between a pure event and a description of the circumstances under which it
happened. The "inaccessible" interval is called perfective, the accessible one
imperfective. Perfectivity is usually expressed by tense or a combination of
tense and adverbial.$
(ii) Progressivity
$ Another contrast is made between events that are in progress (dynamic) or not
(stative). This is done with tense and is found in all Western European
languages;
they differ, however, in markedness (progressive and "local" tenses). Comrie
(1976) argues that progressivity is
a subclassification of imperfectivity.$

_c) Aktionsart_:
$ As assumed, sentences describe events (or situations). These events have some
inherent time properties:$

$ (i) Every event (or situation) has duration, so it must be represented as an
interval. Even the point of speech has duration in reality, but because it is
seen as the basic unit, it is generally called a point.$

$ (ii) Events are felt to be inherently "momentaneous", "terminative" or 
"durative"
because of the knowledge of the world every speaker has. They are related to
a speechunit and to each other on the basis of experience.$
$ So if two events are presented neutrally (i.e. without means of
perfectivity or progressivity) as co-occurring, then a normal interpretation is
that
the event inherently taking more time is felt as a situation during which the
other
is taking place. If the difference is very small, then they are felt to 
really co-occur.$
examples: Jan werkte in de tuin, toen Marie binnenkwam
          De bom ontplofte, toen Marie binnenkwam
          Marie kwam binnen, toen de bom ontplofte
          Jan las een artikel, toen Marie dat examen deed
          Jan las mijn proefschrift, toen Marie dat examen deed
$ The readings of all these sentences can differ according to whether the bomb
is exploding in several phases, Marie enters via a tunnel, the article is very
long or the exam very short etc.. However, people often have the 
intuition that events can be classified according to their inherent time
properties.$
$ Events or situations are often classified in the following way (cf. Dowty
(1979), De Vuyst (1983), Oversteegen and Verkuyl (1985)):$
_statives_       : durative, stative, descriptive.
                 A stative event is true for arbitrarily many time units.
_activities_     : durative, dynamic, the result or end is not expressed
                 An activity is true for more than one time unit.
_accomplishments_: terminative, a result or end is expressed, until that limit
                 durative and dynamic
                 An accomplishment is true for one time unit.
_achievement_    : terminative, non-durative, momentaneous, dynamic
                 An achievement is true for one time unit.
$ Tests for these classes are combinations with certain adverbials:$
$ For example, duratives combine with adverbials such as "3 uur", "enkele
weken". Terminatives can also be combined with them, but in this case they get
a durative or
frequentative reading:$
Example:
   Jan liep drie uur.
   Jan liep drie uur de 100 meter.
$ On the other hand, terminatives combine with adverbials such as "in drie uur"
or "binnen enkele weken". Duratives will get a terminative reading in that
case.$

(iii) There exists a certain relationship with aspect:
$ Statives and activities (duratives) can be considered as imperfective,
accomplishments and
achievements (terminatives) as perfective. (In Oversteegen and Verkuyl(1985) the
duratives
provide an injection from the E to the S track and the terminatives provide a
convergence operation). This classification refers to the
"outside" of the 
event. Statives and achievements are non-progressive (they are true for the
smallest time unit, S), activities and accomplishments progressive (they are
true for more units than the smallest time unit). This classification refers to
the "inside" of the event.
This relationship with aspect can cause incompatibility between Aktionsart and
certain aspect tenses and/or adverbials.$

Examples: *This book is belonging to him (stative + progressivity)
          *He died for a while (momentaneous + durative)

$ Aktionsart is inherent to events that are expressed by a verb and its
arguments and is not inherent to the verb alone. (cf. Verkuyl(1972))$

Examples: Hij schrijft (activity)
          hij schrijft een brief (accomplishment)

$ In a translation process we
have to require that the Aktionsart does
not change when mapping lexical items into each other. In other words, the
lexical items and their composition should express how long an event will
take in real time (knowledge of the world), whether there is or is not an end
or result, and whether it is stative or dynamic.$

$ So, a combination of tense and adverbials in a sentence and a place in the
consecutio temporum of the sentences in a text represent a time reference of an
event in the time model with respect to S,  with specification of some time
intervals and/or relations and its aspect relation to the other events in
complement, main or other sentences of the text.$

_1.2 Translation and time_

$ A first question that occurs in translating time is whether every "facet" of
time
concepts has a correspondent in every language or if every time expression in
a language has a correspondent in every other language with the same 
meaning and implications. This is the same question as how ambiguous
languages are with respect to each other in time expressions.$
$ Givon (1978) gives three theoretical possibilities for such correspondent 
problems:$

1) _The "slicing the pie"-problem_
$ Two languages may have in principle the same means for expressing something,
but there is no one-to-one correspondence between those means
For example, two languages may have the same
sort of tenses, but the time reference they express is not always the same,
although the set of possible time references is identical. This kind of problem
gives one the impression that the resulting ambiguities can be solved by means
of a
deeper analysis.$
example: both English and Dutch have a present and a present perfect tense.

         - Hij woont hier al 20 jaar
         - He has lived here for twenty years

         These sentences express the same time reference, but use different
         tenses. However, this is not always the case:

         - Hij woont hier
         - He lives here

         - Hij heeft hier gewoond
         - He has lived here

$ 2) _The specificity problem_$
$ Two languages differ in specificity of a concept. One language has two
expressions, that are not real synonyms,  and the other has got only one.
Now, is either the first language too specific and do we loose the information
of the
difference during translation or is the second one ambiguous and do we have to
analyse it deeper?$
Example: Progressive tenses and Simple tenses
         Dutch: o.t.t. and  "is aan het + infinitief"(marked)
         English : Present progressive
         (This example only deals with nonstatives)

3) _The lexical vs syntactic form problem_

$ Another translation problem can emerge when two translation equivalents
do
not have the same form: one has a "lexical" form, the other a "syntactic" form.
This is only a problem when the lexical form and the
syntactic form  cannot correspond in a certain translation system.
So this is not a conceptual
problem, but one of formalism.$
example: tense and adverbial
         English: He has just arrived (just + arrive(Present Perfect))
         Spanish: El acaba de llegar (acaba(Presente) de + llegar(Infinitivo))
$ "Acabar de" can be seen as an auxiliary and "acaba de + Infinitivo" as a
periphrastic tense form.
"Just" is an adverb (meaning "zojuist") that requires a Perfect Tense of the
verb.$
$ This phenomenon is not an exception; there exist more of such periphrastic
tense forms in Spanish that correspond to combinations of tenses and adverbials
in other languages (cf. Rohrer (1977) for more examples).$
$ Note that if the adverbial could be modified, a serious problem would emerge
that maybe is insolvable (similar problems can turn up with "translation
idioms").$

$ So there is not always a one-to-one correspondence between expressions of
time in language, because of a "slicing-the pie" and/or a "specificity"
problem.
Our task will be to find out if a deeper analysis will lead to better and
less ambiguous translations.
The third kind of translation problem can also emerge in Rosetta, because basic
expressions ("lexical" forms) cannot correspond to rules ("syntactic" forms).$
$ The ways in which the grammars of Spanish and English introduce respectively
"acabar de"
and "just" in the example above (i.e. categorematically or
syncategorematically) have to be attuned to each other in Rosetta.$

Posssible solutions could be for example:
a) categorematically:
$ Assume that VERB(arrive) and VERB(llegar) are basic expressions with the same
basic meaning and so are
ADV(just) and VERB(acabar de).$
$ Then the following application of rules of the grammars G (English) and G' 
(Spanish) can be considered analogous to the like-graag problem in
Landsbergen (1984):$

G: R%1%: VERB(arrive) + VAR(x%i%)  --> CL1(x%i% arrive)
   R%2%: ADV(just) + VAR(x%i%) + VAR(x%j%)  --> ADVP(x%i% just x%j%)
   R%3,j%: CL1(x%i% arrive) + ADVP(x%i% just x%j%)  --> CL1(x%i% just have
                                                       arrived)

G' R'%1%: VERB1(llegar) + VAR(x%i%) --> CL1(x%i% llegar)
   R'%2%: VERB2(acabar de) + VAR(x%i%) + VAR(x%j%) --> CL2(x%i% acabar de x%j%)
   R'%3,j%: CL1(x%1% llegar) + CL2(x%i% acabar de x%j%) -->
            CL1(x%1% acabar de (llegar))

b) syncategorematically:
$ Assume that VERB(arrive) and VERB(llegar) are basic expressions with the same
meaning and furthermore R%1% and R'%1% of a) are rules of G and G'. Then the
following rules can be imagined:$

R%4%: CL1(x%i% arrive)  --> CL1(x%i% just have arrived)
R'%4%: CL1(x%i% llegar)  --> CL1(x%i% acabar de llegar)


$NP
_2. Time in Rosetta2_

_Scope with respect to translation of time_
$ The grammars of Rosetta2 only have to deal with:$
$ - sentences that have no time relation to context sentences$
$ - sentences without "subsentences of time", so that the time or aspect
relation between main and subsentence need not be explicitly expressed; only
complement sentences are considered.$
$ - sentences that can contain time adverbs, but that have no or just an
incidental
influence on the
  tense; adverbs are translated locally.$

_Grammars with respect to time_
$ So the grammars contain a theory in order to translate tenses and to do
something with
the consecutio temporum in complement sentences (supertense), taking into
account the possibility that infinitive complement sentences are translated
in finite ones. In the English
grammar a relation between Aktionsart (activity,
non-activity) and progressivity is also taken into account.$
$ All tenses are introduced syncategorematically. What was understood by "tense
"
can be found in the declarations or domain T (Landsbergen (1985)).$
$ Only grammars for Dutch and English were written.$

_Interlingua with respect to time_:
$ All rules that introduce a tense have an equivalent in the interlingua. So 
every tense of a language is represented in the interlingua. This means
that the IL contains an expression for "o.t.t." and one for "Simple Present".
The generative transfer maps every IL-expression to a target language
expression. The IL is very ambiguous in this approach. It has merged all slices
of pies and every slice is mapped to every possible corresponding slice,
although it seems that with deeper analysis, -the requirement of presence or
absence of certain adverbials for example-, the resulting ambiguity could be
limited.$
$ Adding a language to the system will
cause more ambiguity in this approach, because every language will add its own
tenses. In the future the interaction between
tense and adverbials should be taken better care of; the translation probably
would get better, because the adverbials could desambiguate. Consideration
of
text or discourse time relations would certainly also have a desambiguating
effect.$

$NP
_3. Time variables and abstract basic expressions_

$ In the Rosetta2-grammar tenses are introduced syncategorematically. Every
tense
corresponds to (the name of) a rule (an external parameter). It is possible to
introduce tenses categorematically by giving those names of rules or external
parameters a basic category and letting them function as abstract basic
expressions. This gives us the possibility to solve the discrepancy between a
rule
and a basic expression that was mentioned above. The alternative of course, is
to
introduce such basic expressions of time syncategorematically.$
$ In the abstract basic expression approach it is also possible to form complex
basic expressions (idiomatic expressions) that consist of, for example, a
tense
and an adverb.$
$ For example: In order to have _just_ + _Present Perfect Tense_ correspond to
_"acaba
de tense"_ one of the possibilities is to form a complex basic expression
from _just_ and _Present Perfect Tense_.$ 
$ The alternative is to introduce a complex rule that does the same. The two
approaches are
equivalent.$
$ A choice for abstract basic expressions gives us the possibility of
substituting
them for a time variable in the sentence. This would give us the possibility
to use "the trick with variables" instead of the mysterious supertense. The
variables will have the properties now expressed by supertense (omega, present
and past)$
$ Having a time variable in every sentence corresponds to the intuition that
every event must be placed in time, so some time reference must be substituted
for it. Partially, this time reference must be bound by the time
reference of the main sentence in the case of 
complement sentences or other sentences in the text (or discourse).$

$NP
_4. First approach to translating time in next Rosetta versions_

$ _Requirements_$

$ A first approach to time for the new Rosetta versions should contain:$
$ (i) a more fundamental approach to the interlingua expressions for time$
$ (ii) a try-out with time variables and abstract basic expressions$
$ (iii) at least equivalent translation power as Rosetta2 (probably this
implies a translation of tenses without desambiguation by means of adverbs)$
$ (iv) incorporation of Dutch, English and Spanish time expressions$

$ A more fundamental approach to the interlingua expressions will mean avoiding
the occurrence  of both concepts "o.t.t." and "simple present" in the
interlingua.
For this purpose we could use the theory of time reference of Reichenbach
(1947).$

_Reichenbach's theory of time_

The time model of Reichenbach consists of an axis with three points:
Point of speech: S
Point of reference: R
Point of event: E
Between these points two relations can exist:
x -- y: x earlier than y
x,y : x simultaneous with y
$ Every English tense is given a representation in this model. For the
progressives Reichenbach uses"_E_".$

So we get:
E -- R -- S    -----  anterior past      ----  Past Perfect Tense
E,R -- S       -----  simple past        ----  Simple Past Tense
R -- E -- S   --|
R -- S,E      --|---  posterior past     ----  Conditional Tense?
R -- S -- E   --|
E -- S,R       -----  anterior present   ----  Present Perfect Tense
S,R,E          -----  simple present     ----  Simple Present Tense
S,R -- E       -----  posterior present  ----  Future Tense
S -- E -- R  --|
S,E -- R     --|---   anterior future    ----  Future Perfect Tense
E -- S -- R  --|
S -- R,E      -----   simple future      ----  Future Tense
S -- R -- E   -----   posterior future   ----       ?

(I leave out the variants with _E_)

There are three problems with this system:
1) a notation problem:
   the position of E with respect to S  sometimes is not clear.
2) the conditional perfect is missing. This could be caused by an English
   convention not to consider the conditional as a tense and the involvement of
   two R's.
3) there are only time points and no time intervals. But as was said above
   E has duration and should be an interval.

$ We can solve the first problem by adopting a slightly different notation:
the two relations of every representation wil be coordinated by "and";
the first relation is the one between S and R, the second the one between R and
E.
The second problem can be solved by allowing for two R's and a relation "--"
between two R's. Concerning the third problem, this is not very important here.
The points in this model all can be seen as intervals as well. The relativity
with respect to the intervals and points in question is not taken into account
in this model.$

$ Using this formalism for the IL-expressions (the S,R,E representations or
their names) the grammars must be tuned to
each other. Each tense must be represented in this formalism and those
representations will form the IL. Of course this approach will not solve all
the
ambiguities of the IL. All tenses are mapped to IL-expressions, keeping in mind
that the mapping from IL-expressions to tenses of a particular language will
result in all possible translations _in all ("time")contexts_.
Because these context properties are not specified in the IL, the IL will be
underspecified
with respect to time and will therefore possibly cause wrong translations,
because
necessary information will be lost sometimes. If we want to avoid this, we can
make the mapping ambiguous, so that it will always contain a "good" one.
This strategy was also used in Rosetta2, but because Rosetta2 behaves more like
a transfer system with respect to time, an ambiguity that is caused by one
language does not necessary exist between the other languages. It is always
clear what was
the source  language in the generative transfer component.
In the new approach the ambiguity of the interlingua will tell how
ambiguous the translations will be in every language.$
$ Some possibilities may be ruled out by desambiguation with adverbials. Maybe
others can be taken care of when Aktionsart and relations between events
(aspect) are considered too (see also section 5).$

$ The S,R,E representations of Reichenbach are composed of two, sometimes three
elements:$
1) relation between S and R
2) relation between R%1% and R%2% (optional)
3) relation between R and E
$ Maybe we should take these elements to be the basic expressions of IL and not
their composition.$
$ The first relation in the IL-expression (between S and R) can be used for the
supertense or as a variable property that is used instead.$

Provisional scheme for the three languages:

   IL-expression            English             Dutch          Spanish

1) R -- S and E -- R:  Past Perfect Prog.       v.v.t.         plusquamperfecto
                       Past Perfect                            preterito?

2) R -- S and E,R   :  Past Prog.               o.v.t.         imperfecto
                       Simple Past              v.t.t.         preterito

                       Present Prog.            o.t.t.         presente

9) S -- R and R -- E:        ?                    ?               ?

10) R%1% -- S and R%1% -- R%2% and E -- R%2%:
                       Conditional Perfect      v.v.t.t.       condicional 
                                                               perfecto

I think that if we used this scheme for the translation of time, it would
have equivalent translation power with respect to time as Rosetta2.

_5) Problems_

$ In this section I will mention some problems that arise with the
IL-expressions of
section
4 and the tenses that correspond to them from a translation point of view.
I will discuss them successively and indicate their nuances. Most of the
translation problems will deal with matters of aspect (perfectivity and
progressivity), Aktionsart, "specification of the R's" and a notion of
"completion". All of these notions are candidates for information that should
not be lost during translation.$

_R -- S and E -- R_: anterior past
$ With the "Past Perfect Progressive" the E-interval probably includes R, while
with the "v.v.t",
the "preterito" and the "Past Perfect" it explicitly does not. The
"plusquamperfecto"
seems to be
ambiguous with respect to this point. Maybe we need a notion of
completion of E at R here. The R must always be "specified" by an adverbial or
bound by context. Smith (1981) speaks of an "anchor", according to Oversteegen
and Verkuyl (1985) in the Two Track Theory the contribution of some tenses
is that a reference point   S is realized and changed to S' and Des Tombe
et al. (1984) have "specifying" relations.$

_R -- S and E,R_: simple past
$ This IL-expression corresponds to many tenses. One of the properties they all
seem to have in common when used as translation equivalents is that the R must
be specified by an adverbial or context. If R is not specified, the anterior
present
is used. The Spanish "perfecto" requires that if R is specified, the
"distance" to S is not very long, while the "preterito" preferably is not
used when the "distance" is rather short.$
$ The "imperfecto", "o.v.t." and "Past Progressive" have all the implication
that E
does not need to be completed before S, while the "preterito", "perfecto",
"Simple
Past" and "v.t.t." indicate that E is completed before S.
The first group can be considered to be imperfective (accessible), the latter
perfective (inaccessible).$

_R -- S and R -- E_: posterior past
$ If R is specified, it is a real future with respect to the past reference
point in question, and nothing is claimed about a relation between E and S.
The tenses that
correspond to this IL-expression are also used to express some kind of
modality.$

_R,S and E -- R_: anterior present
$ This expression indicates an event that started in the past and can be going
on
at S. E cannot be specified by a past deictic adverbial. It is looked at from S
(S,R) and has "present relevance"(cf. Krauwer and Des Tombe (1985)). The
expression is ambiguous between an event
already completed at S and an event still going on at S.
The tenses that correspond are not always ambiguous with respect to this point.
The "v.t.t" and the "perfecto" indicate a completed event on S, while the
"o.t.t." 
and the "presente" do not. Perhaps the "Present Perfect" and the "Present
Perfect
Progressive" indicate the same contrast for dynamic events.
The time between the beginning of E and R may be specified.$

_R,S and E,R_: simple present
$ In English there are two possibilities: "Present" for stative verbs and
Present
Progressive" for dynamic verbs. A "Present" for dynamic verbs gets an
"habitual"
interpretation. This seems to be an aspect-Aktionsart question: the "Present
Tense" indicates that an event is true at the moment of speech, but activity
or accomplishment events cannot be true at such a moment. Activities cannot
be true at one unit of time and accomplishments cannot at such a small unit
of time. Achievements can be true at S in principle, but only if they run in
parallel with S, otherwise they will be seen as accomplishments. De Vuyst
(1983) claims that in English dynamic events are inherently "inaccessible"(or
perfective) and that a progressive tense is used to make them "accessible".
Stative events have no problems with truth at a point or whatever unit of time
because of their Aktionsart. Therefore they do not need a progressive tense.
The norm for progressivity is the moment of speech in present tenses in
English, because a present tense only claims truth at the moment of speech.
(The Aktionsart, however, is responsible for the implications). This could also
explain why there exists something like "reportive present": the event is
running in
parallel with the "moment" of speech.$
$ It could be that Dutch and Spanish do not have such a strict claim for their
present
tenses. Maybe a present tense in these languages merely requires that the
moment
of speech be included in the interval for which the event is true (this is in
accordance with the phenomena with respect to IL-expression anterior present);
it could be
considered "imperfective".
Or, as De Vuyst suggests, Dutch (and Spanish) dynamic events are not
"inaccessible". However, the Spanish progressive tense is less "marked" than
the
Dutch (compare "estar + gerundio" with "aan het + infinitief + zijn"). (cf.
Comrie (1976))$

_R,S and R -- E_: posterior present
$ Maybe this expression corresponds more appropriately to periphrastic
expressions that
indicate near future such as "gaan + infinitief", "to be going to +
Infinitive",
"ir a + Infinitivo".$
$ Another possibility is to reserve this expression for events in the future
without a specified reference point in the future. In that case, it cannot
correspond
to "o.t.t.", "Present Prog." or "presente" as opposed to the simple future.
(see below)$

_S -- R and E -- R_: anterior future
$ The same remarks as with the anterior present could be made here. Perhaps
the
"Future Perfect" indicates that the event can maximally last until R, while the
"Future Perfect Progressive" indicates that R will be included in the interval
of E.$
$ Maybe we should add here, analogously to the case with the anterior present
in
Dutch and Spanish respectively, the "o.t.t.t." and the "futuro".$

- In 1990 he will have been living there for 20 years.
- In 1990 zal hij daar dan al 20 jaar gewoond hebben
- In 1990 zal hij daar dan al 20 jaar wonen????

_S -- R and E,R_: simple future
$ The "Simple Future Tense", the "o.t.t.t." and the "futuro" seem to indicate
rather
neutrally that at some point or interval in the future an event will be true.
The "Future Progressive Tense" will tie the truth of an event to some point or
time unit in the future (that must be specified by an adverbial or context)
and is used to express an aspect contrast in the future
for dynamic events.$
$ The "Present Progressive", "o.t.t." and "Presente" are often used in
combination
with a future adverb or context. It gives an impression of appointment and
probability. It also gives a completed or perfective impression.$
examples:
- John is cooking tomorrow (John is cooking a meal tomorrow)
- &?&While Mary is making the beds, John is cooking tomorrow (the events are
  "inaccessible")
- I am seeing him tomorrow (I have an appointment to meet him tomorrow)

_S -- R and R -- E_: posterior future
$ The languages do not seem to have a corresponding tense, so we do not need
this expression for the interlingua. It only could be used to indicate a future
analogue of the perifrastic expressions of near future (cf. posterior present).
However, in that case
there should also be a past analog: R -- S and R -- E, which was reserved for
the conditional tenses. But we could make use of the above mentioned
possibility of
the two R's for the conditional tenses: R%1% -- S and R%1% -- R%2% and R%2%,E.$
$ This would also restore the analogy between the representations of future
and conditional tenses.$

10) _R_%1%_ -- S and R_%1%_ -- R_%2%_ and E -- R_%2%: anterior posterior past 
$ This could be the representation of the conditional perfect tenses. Like
the posterior past this expression can have a modal character. Maybe this
modal character is a characteristic of all expressions that contain a "future"
element (posterior past, posterior present, anterior future, simple future,
posterior future, anterior posterior past). Jansen (1983) also argues for a
modal "zullen" in Dutch.$

$ Summarizing, we can say that a solution with Reichenbach expressions as
IL-expressions provides us with a more fundamental approach the IL, but that
it does not solve all the problems we have in translating concepts of time.
The IL-expressions are semantically not differentiated enough; they are still
ambiguous in some respect. However, how ambiguous they are also depends on
what the aim of the translation system is. A sentence without any context often
will be ambiguous with respect to time reference (R = S or R is bound by
context) and/or aspect (when the aspect relation with the other event(s) goes
beyond the sentence boundary).$
$ Depending on what will be the "unit of translation" in next Rosetta versions
attention should be paid to the following questions:$

$ a) the unit of translation is _clause_ without any complement or subclauses
(i.e. one event)$

$ 1) How can adverbials help to desambiguate?$
$ 2) What kind of role does Aktionsart play in a translation system?$
$ 3) How can notions of "aspect" and "completion" improve translation of time?$

$ b) the unit of translation is _sentence_ with eventually complement and
subsentences (Rosetta3?) (i.e. one or more events)$

$ 4) What kind of time or aspect relations can exist between matrix, complement
and subclauses?$
$ 5) How does the time model work with more events that have a relation to each
other and to the moment of speech?$
$ 6) Can we use the same model for the time relation between a matrix clause
and a relative clause?$
$ 7) What is the role of a "specific R" or "anchor" in this context?$

$ c) the unit of translation is _text_$

$ 8) Is a text unambiguously "anchored" in time?$
$ 9) What kind of relations can exist between sentences of a text? Are they the
same as between matrix, complement and subclauses?$

$ We should also consider other kinds of time aspects than perfectivity and
progressivity such as inchoativity, termination, frequency, habituality,
"crescendo effect", recency etc.. This research will certainly involve
investigation of periphrastic tenses and adverbials.$
$ The interaction with modality that turns up in the future times, but also
in the time references of events that are represented by modal verbs should
not be neglected (cf. Slager (1981), Verslag modaliteit Rosetta2).$
$ Maybe another topic is the difference between "actual" and "dispositional"
readings of events (cf. Des Tombe(1984)):$

Example: John plays chess. (disposition)
         John is playing chess. (actual)
