\section{Introduction}
After attending the conference on Theoretical and Methodological Issues in
Machine Translation of Natural Languages in Austin, USA  in june this year,
I started reading the proceedings and made an overview of the contents. This
overview might interest other people that do not have much time to read
all the proceedings. I have 
also added a summary of a paper on machine translation
in the ACL-proceedings 1990 and a report on the demonstration of the
METAL system I attended.

\section{Summaries of papers at the MT conference}
The MT conference was the Third International Conference on Theoretical and
Methodological Issues in Machine Translation which was organized by the
Linguistics Research Center of the University of Texas at Austin this year.
It contained papers about current research in MT, approaches to MT,
interlinguality and issues in analysis, lexicography, grammar and semantics in
MT. Some attention was paid to the question how to evaluate MT-systems.\\

I will give a brief summary of  all papers at this conference. For more 
details, proceedings are
 available. The summaries below might be too summary 
to be understood, but then the reader is also referred to the proceedings.

\subsection{General Papers}
Harold Somers: {\bf Current Research in MT}\\
This introductory paper was given by Harold Somers from UMIST, England. It 
contains
a very personal view on the current research in MT. It is claimed that the 
second generation  systems main characteristics are modularity and 
stratificational
approach. This approach has two problems: 1) stress on what is feasible in
analysis  and 2) the
first choice is structure preserving translation. This is done with the
assumption that the source text contains enough information
to permit translation. For that
reason the results are not better than those of first generation systems
(Systran, Spanam). Examples of second generation commercial
systems are METAL and a few Japanese systems.\\
An overview of research descended from second generation architecture was given:
\begin{itemize}
\item research with {\bf AI-techniques}: KMBT (Carnegie Mellon University)\\
problem: step from toy system to a more practical implementation.
\item research with {\bf better linguistic theories}: Eurotra(all theories),
 Rosetta(MG), ENtran(LFG, GPSG and CG) and
other systems based on LFG, GPSG, CG, FG, Situation Semantics or LG.\\
problem: the theories  can never be applied purely.
\item research with {\bf sublanguage}:  several projects at UMIST
\end{itemize}
Somers concluded with mentioning the current projects undertaken in his own
institute (UMIST):
\begin{itemize}
\item with {\bf sublanguage plus}: a system with a bilingual corpus of typical
 texts
from which the grammar and lexicon are extracted using statistical methods that
are `primed' with linguistic knowledge.
\item with {\bf automatic grammar up-dating}: a system that corrects errors by
feedback of posteditors called PECOF.
\item with {\bf different design for different users}: in the past, systems were
developed for the `watcher' (rough translations for end-user), then for the
`revisor'(posteditors) and for the `translator' (interactive systems). Recent
systems are for the `writer'\footnote{the characterization is from Christian 
Boitet}. In this last development we see systems for 
{\bf monolingual} users (e.g. ENtran), not only for the source language,
 but also for the target language (systems for the `reader'). New MT-projects
should start with the definition of the {\bf users} needs. The system proposed 
is a translator from English into Bahasa Maylasia for scientific textbooks and
will be of the `interactive user-driven type' where the use is a domain expert
and with reasonable but not native-speaker fluency in the source language.
\item with {\bf dialogue MT}: a system aimed at a user who is the author of a 
text
to be composed in  a foreign language (system for the `writer'). The
 difference with other interactive approaches is that the interaction takes 
place before the text is input: the text is composed automatically. 
\item with {\bf statistics based MT}: as the results from experiments (e.g.\ 
IBM) are
interesting, statistical methods are used in the sublanguage project (see 
above).

\end{itemize}
\subsection{Approaches to Machine Translation}
Bonnie Dorr: {\bf A Cross-Linguistic Approach to Translation}\\
The paper describes the UNITRAN system, a machine translation system that 
translates between Spanish, English and German (and in the future Walpiri) 
bidirectionally and is
developed at MIT, Cambridge, USA. The main characteristic is that it operates
cross-linguistically. This is a difficult task because  of syntactic and
lexical divergences. The framework provides two levels: one for lexico-semantic
information and one for syntactic information. Translation is done on basis of the 
interaction of these two levels. The syntactic level is based on principles
of GB (Chomsky) and the lexico-semantic level is based on the lexical conceptual
structure (LCS) that is built compositionally (Jackendoff and others). The LCS
functions as pivot and contains 25 primitive notions now.
 The syntactic distinctions between languages are reflected by
parameters. Crucial for translation are the lexical selection and syntactic
realization operations. The system has possibilities to mark divergences from
the general operations, e.g.\ to indicate that arguments have to be switched
(thematic divergence, see ACL-paper by Dorr) and to indicate what has to be
realized syntactically and what not (conflational divergence). It is claimed
that other divergence types also can be handled. The system is limited, because
it only works for isolated sentences, there are more target possiblities for
one LCS-primitive and a lot of words have to be selected directly, and there
are no provisions for tense and aspect. A lot of observations (and solutions)
are already known from the literature (to which no reference is made)
and the new approach seems to be
contained in the application of LCS as an interlingua for an MT-system.\\


Xiuming Huang: {\bf  Machine Translation in a Monolingual Environment}\\
In this paper the {\em selective confirmation approach} to MT is described.
This approach is meant for a system that aims at the target language inexpert.
It is assumed that translation will take place from the user's native language 
in some target language ({\em export translation}) and that some quality 
checking
is needed for accuracy (not style), because this is not possible yet without
human assistence and because ambiguities are not always solvable within a
limited
context. The central issue now is how to assure the user that the translation 
is accurate.
Several approaches are discussed:
\begin{enumerate}
\item back translation:  unreliable\\
a) in case of reversible grammars there is no control\\
b) in case of different grammars: is the forward or the back translation wrong?
\item paraphrasing of analysis results: expensive and it assumes that 
generation is reliable.
\item pre-editing: costs a lot of training
\item interactive disambiguation:\\
a) lexical level: there are often a lot of senses and the frequency of the 
questions will be high\\
b) structural level: there are often a lot of interpretations (cf. Ntran)
\end{enumerate}
In the new approach, the selective confirmation approach, only at decision 
making
points human assistence will be asked. These points will be at constituent 
level. Lexical disambiguation will be postponed, because semantic constraints 
can also  disambiguate. This approach will result in less 
(yes-no) questions. Domain and statistical information to 
arrange the lexicon will be added to order the questions.\\

Dan Jones and Jun-chi Tsujii: {\bf Interactive High-Quality Translation for 
Monolinguals}\\
The system described is developed for British Telecom and enables the user to
compose texts in a foreign language with no knowledge of the target language.
It is a system for the `writer' based on Functional Grammar. The interaction
takes place before the text is input in the form of a dialogue between system 
and user. The text to be translated is then worked out, taking into account
the user's goals and the system's translation ability. The actual system 
translates business correspondence on the basis of pre-translated fragments of 
stereotypical texts with slots in them filled by interaction.\\
It should be noted that there is a severe limitation on what the system can be
 used for.\\
The paper is very difficult to read. This summary is mainly based on the 
overview of Somers, who also presented a paper at Coling 1990.\\

Kiyoshi Kogure, Masako Kume and Hitoshi Iida: {\bf Illocutionary Act Based 
Translations of Dialogues}\\
In this paper a new method  based on pragmatics is proposed to translate 
dialogues.
In this method {\em illocutionary act relationships} are extracted from input
sentences by using semantic-pragmatic representations called
{\em illocutionary act types} which consist of language-independent 
illocutionary act concepts and language-dependent propositional content 
concepts. These
are transferred into target illocutionary act types and finally, target language
utterances are generated. This method combines features of the transfer and the
interlingual approach.\\
Dialogue utterances involve various kinds of communicative acts and different
kinds of linguistic devices are used to represent them in different languages.
For example, such {\em speech acts} as e.g.\ stating, questioning, requesting,
promising and apologizing are translated in a very different manner in English
and Japanese.\\
An {\em illocutionary act type} is a feature structure containing an
{\em illocutionary force relationship} (e.g.\ assertive, rogative-if), an 
{\em agent}(speaker), a {\em recipient} (hearer), an {\em object}
 (the propositional content), a
{\em manner} (achievement mode: directly, indirectly etc.) and {\em politeness
 roles}(respect, polite etc.).\\
The syntactic-semantic component has a HPSG, unification-based approach.\\

Eiichiro Sumita, Hitoshi Iida and Hideo Koyama: {\bf Translating with Examples:
A New Approach to Machine Translation}\\
In this paper, Example-Based Machine Translation (EBMT) is proposed. EBMT 
retrieves {\em similar} examples (pairs of source texts and their translations)
 from
the database, adapting them to translate a new source text and is developed at
 ATR Interpreting Telephony Research Laboratories.\\
The reasons for this approach are a) that is it is difficult to go over from a
toy program to a practical system because of the required knowledge, e.g.\ 
dictionaries and grammar rules and b) that it is difficult to improve the
translation ability of a system because of the fact that it is difficult to 
anticipate the effect of the addition of a new rule and because a large-scale 
rule-based system is time-consuming. The database of examples should be seen 
as the knowledge of the system.
Recent progress in hardware such as vast memory and the computing power of
parallel computers makes EBMT a possible research goal now.
The costs of EBMT and conventional Rule-Based MT (RBMT) are compared. 
EBMT costs less, because the computability costs, the improvement costs
(only example adding) and system building costs (no trained linguistic staff) 
are less. EBMT has context-sensitive translation and is very robust. Because
a distance factor between the input and the example is determined, a reliability
factor can be given. The knowledge is independent of the system and can be used
in other systems.\\
The database consists of two parts: the examples and a thesaurus. In the 
example-based transfer  distance calculation between input and examples is 
done measuring the similarity. The calculation of weights of attributes in the 
database is expensive, but 
can also be done when the system is built.\\
 Japanese-to-English examples are given with compounds, aspect and idiomatic 
expressions. \\
The same approach with matching with dependency trees has been taken in the DLT 
project of BSO, Utrecht.\\
Integration of EBMT and RBMT is also discussed: EBMT can be used during
RBMT at the occurence of {\em cue words} such as {\em no} (`of' in compounds) 
and {\em da} (`zijn').\\

Gertjan van Noord, Joke Dorrepaal, Pim van der Eijk, Maria Florenza and Louis 
des Tombe: {\bf The MiMo2 Research System}\\
The MiMo2 translation system is a transfer system that is developed at the 
State University of Utrecht. With respect to the translation the basic ideas of 
Landsbergen (Rosetta) are followed, assuming that translation is 
{\bf symmetric} and
that a source text has many {\bf possible linguistic translations}. 
Computationally the system focusses on {\bf computability} and {\bf 
declaritivity}. The linguistics  are based on a {\bf lexicalistic} and 
{\bf sign-based 
approach} to grammar. The symmetric approach and the computibility requirement
lead to {\bf reversibility} of the system. The lexicalistic approach yields
a small amount of general rules and a lot of rich lexical entries (HPSG).
The sign-based approach means that  the linguistic objects are partial 
information structures which allows interleaved processing of phonology, syntax
and semantics. The system uses unification grammars and is implemented in
Prolog. The domain of application is a specific text type: international news
items of teletext which yields a kind of sublanguage. The sentence is the
unit of translation and the system works for Dutch, English and Spanish.
The paper contains examples of Dutch Verb Clustering, Spanish Verb 
Movement\footnote{Note that the given examples in the paper are all 
ungrammatical!}(Dutch
Verb Second is similar), relative clauses and the analysis of PPs. Also some
transfer examples with idioms, thematic divergence and control verbs are
explained. The current research is on quantification, modification, 
coordination and verb/noun collocations and topics related to discourse 
(e.g.\ pronoun
resolution).\\

R\'{e}mi Zajac: {\bf A Relational Approach to Translation}\\
The system described is a transfer system with reversible source and target 
language and
a reversible contrastive grammar which is developed in the POLYGLOSS project
in Stuttgart. The approach to the transfer component is based on a logic
formalism (TFS) which has feature terms  as basic data structures and on
term rewriting. It integrates a powerful typing mechanism. The grammars are
inherently reversible. It allows to specify and compute {\bf relations} 
between classes of linguistic objects defined as feature types. There is
only one compiler for the whole system which is implemented in Common-Lisp. 
The approach is compared to an
approach with LFG (Kaplan et al.) with a co-description mechanism that has 
an analysis/transfer and a generation part.\\
 The approach described here seems
to me similar to the approach
of the MiMo2-system described above but differs w.r.t.\ the fact that the
relational approach does not need a compiler that is controlled by certain
annotations or `leading attributes'.

\subsection{Issues in Machine Translation Grammar}
Lori Levin: {\bf Syntactic Theory and Grammar Design for Machine Translation}\\
This very clear paper adresses the question of the place of linguistic
theory in MT. It focusses on syntactic theory in knowledge-based MT (especially
the KMBT system at the center for MT at Carnegie Mellon University) and argues 
that a productive interweaving of theory with practical concerns  can be
achieved. The most salient contributions of syntactic theory are:
\begin{itemize}
\item cross-linguistically valid levels of representation
\item strategies for analyzing a number of basic constructions
\end{itemize}
Efficiency reasons  or the structure of the system cause deviations of the
rules of theoretical syntax. The paper presents an overview of the role of
syntax (based on LFG) and the problems with grammar design in the KBMT-89 
system, an interlingual knowledge-based system  in which the emphasis is on 
content rather than form. The major role of the syntactic component
is to extract and encode information in syntactic constituents and to make 
this information accessible
to other components of the system.
One class of problems in the grammar design is concerned with ambiguity, 
ill-formed input, robustness and the definition of the sublanguage (KMBT-89 
translates
personal computer manuals). A second class is concerned with the integration 
of syntax with other components: the interlingua and the programs have influence
on the syntax (e.g.\ efficiency). 
And a third class consists of good grammar formalisms and grammar debugging 
tools.
Designing a grammar involves juggling many priorities and decisions in 
combinations that will differ for each application and each system architecture.
Syntactic theory does not help with concrete rules, but with general principles
and strategies.\\

Louisa Sadler, Ian Crookston and Doug Arnold: {\bf LFG and Translation}\\
It is argued that translating with LFG as proposed in Kaplan et al.\ with
co-descriptions is at least as difficult as in transfer systems. The paper
focusses on multiwords (translation idioms), i.e.\ cases in which one language
 uses two words and the other language only one (the phenomenon is also called
incorporation), and adresses the problem of the unwanted regular compositional
translation of the multiword and the non-translation of part of it in case of
an `incorporation-translation'. If rules allow for the latter, other
non-translations cannot be avoided. In case of incorporated adjuncts, the 
situation is even worse in this approach as adjuncts cannot be referred to in 
lexical entries.
In a constructive or representation based transfer system this problem does not
exist as the transfer rules specify that the multiword expression has to be
translated as a unit. Problem with the LFG approach to MT proposed by Kaplan et
al. is that the transfer lexicon is organised in the same way
as the source language lexicon.
Some extensions are proposed to partially overcome these problems.\\

Dominique Esteval, Afzal Ballim, Graham Russell and Susan Warwick: {\bf A 
Syntax and Semantics for Feature-Structure Transfer}\\
This paper describes in a clear way a transfer component in unification 
formalism in which transfer is seen as a relation between feature structures.
The rules are bidirectional and local.\\
A relation {\em specificity} between rules is defined to get a partial ordering
of the transfer rules in one direction. It is based on the notion 
{\em subsumption} of feature structures in the source language and the number of variables.
It is calculated at compile time and not specified by the linguist.
This ordering can be used for {\em blocking phenomena} in which a specific
translation should block the general interpretation as e.g.\ in {\em
white horse} - {\em schimmel}. If the claim of blocking rules is too strong,
then it can be used to order the results.\\

Paula Newman: {\bf Symmetric Slot Grammar(SSG): A Bi-Directional Design for MT}
\\
This paper gives an outline of a proposal to adapt {\em slot grammar}, a 
head-driven, lexicalistic grammar that is used in the Prolog-based LMT system
developed by McCord at IMB, for bi-directional use (i.e.\ to make it 
reversible). The major adjustments concern mappings between surface and 
transfer inputs/outputs and ordering based on preference rules.
Although there is an influence of unification, the formalism is procedural,
because in a pure unification formalism it is difficult to indicate that a given
attribute must be present. List handling also tends to be difficult.
The new grammar will be used in an MT system context: MT/LASC.\\

Erich Steiner: {\bf Aspects of a Functional Grammar for Machine Translation}\\
A rather vague paper that discusses translation problems with voice within the 
Eurotra framework. The notion voice is extended to {\em diathesis} and 
subdivided into four types: activization, passivization, impersonal and 
de-causativization.  Diathesis operates in different ways on different predicate
types. Four predicate types are distinguished: transitive, ergative, causative
 and one-role.
Impersonal constructions have an empty or full first argument with arbitrary
reference. By going beyond the mere morpho-syntactic active/passive dichotomy
complex transfer can be avoided. An (to me unclear) extension is proposed 
which takes into account focus and theme phenomena
and relies heavily on  Systemic Functional grammar. Especially causativisation
will be treated as a property of construction rather than predicates or 
arguments,
which makes  simple transfer possible.
Examples and relevant literature can be found in the proceedings.
\subsection{Interlinguality and Semantics}
Sergei Nirenburg and Kenneth Goodman: {\bf Treatment of Meaning in MT Systems}\\
The authors believe that fully automated high quality Mt systems can be 
developed only if a realistic way to treat meaning in natuaral languages is 
found. 
The treatment of meaning is considered the crucial point of difference among 
MT approaches. They dispute the claims that meaning-based translation is not 
feasible, that there is no need for this and that meaning 
analysis is even possible. 
The paper discusses a lot of opinions about this topic.
They also suggest that the methodological debate between interlingua and 
transfer approach
to MT is misplaced. The meaning-based approach can in principle be explored in
both architectures, or in a combination of them, although Nirenburg seemed to
be an adherent to the interlingua approach in his presentation of the paper.
\\

Juan Alberto Alonso: {\bf Transfer InterStructure: Designing an `Interlingua'
for Transfer-based MT Systems}\\
Topics of this paper are the relevant factors on the design, role and use of
 a `pivot' syntactic structure between the analysis and synthesis phase of 
transfer-based (non-interactive) MT-systems. The proposed pivot syntactic
structure, The Transfer InterStructure (TIS), is meant for multilingual
systems and does not contain a universal representation for lexical items, nor
for semantic relations. In Eurotra it could be the IS-level and in METAL the
MIR-level. TIS guarantees the independence of analysis and synthesis grammars
and minimizes the size and complexity of transfer modules reducing them, in the
ideal case, to a bilingual lexicon. The paper contains a notation for TIS and
a description of the TIS declaration language. The {\em analysis equivalence
constraint} and {\em meaning preservation constraint} are defined depending
on the notion {\em strong equivalent dependence}. These are impossible to
satisfy because of the existence of compound constructions, multiwords,
function verbs, ellipsis and coordination.  Therefore, the {\em weak analysis
equivalence constraint}, the {\em weak equivalent trees synthesis constraint} 
and the {\em weak meaning preservation constraint} are defined depending on the
notion {\em weak equivalent dependence} in which lexicon-driven transformations
play a role. These latter transformations can add and prune substructures to a
TIS or map substructures in the TIS. General constraints  on TIS are that it 
should contain features instead of nodes, deep information instead of surface
information and no language-specific information (The decision of what that is
is a problem). It is claimed that this kind of syntactic IL-approach is better
 than the the `strong' IL-approach in multilingual systems. It is admitted that
adding a new language would cause redesign of TIS. A variety of TIS is
already used in Eurotra and METAL for indo-european languages. The author is
working at Siemens (METAL) in Barcelona.\\

Winfield S. Bennett: {\bf How Much Semantics is Necessary for MT Systems?}\\
The question of the necessity of deep semantic analysis in an MT system is 
examined and the form of any semantics is explored. Bennett believes that some
semantics will improve the quality of any system, but at the same time he does
not think that deep semantic analysis is essential. The reason for the need of
semantics is ambiguity, but it should be focussed on examples found in the sorts
of texts MT is applied to and not on the well-known unsolvable ones (e.g.\ {\em
the box is in the pen}).  He also claims that a lot of PP-attachment ambiguities
cannot be solved by semantics but should be solved by pragmatics.\\
A semantic component will have its cost. Three important points have to be taken
into account:
\begin{enumerate}
\item {\bf efficiency}: probably, it will reduce the speed of the system: the
 more sophisticated the semantic component the greater the loss of speed.
\item {\bf lexicon/knowledge base acquisition and maintenance}: a more elaborate
semantic analysis will require more time for acquisition and maintenance.
\item {\bf cost effectiveness}, i.e.\ the relationship of expense to the
capability of the system to perform as required. It involves the first two 
points.
\end{enumerate}
Two extreme approaches can be distinguished and are compared: a semantic feature
system and a deep semantic analysis. In a feature system, the semantic 
information is coded in features on the lexical entries and they are handled 
just as
syntactic and morphological information (see e.g.\ the paper of Meya).
 A deep semantic analysis is a distinct and fundamental part of the system.
Bennett concludes that  a full blown analysis will be a bigger investment with
respect to 1. and 2. and
that the financial cost versus the gains in analysis might argue against this
investment whereas a semantic feature system offers a real solution at 
considerably less cost.\\
Finally, he gives a report of a study of computational semantics at LRC at
Austin (dedicated at METAL and supported by Siemens) which has been implemented
on an experimental basis. It consists of three topics which are problems for
all MT systems: aspect (also called
Aktionsart) calculus, verb semantics to be used for disambiguation and 
anaphora resolution from a semantic standpoint.\\

Montserrat Meya: {\bf Semantic disambiguation for PP-Attachment}\\
The paper describes a proposal for semantic disambiguation for PP-attachment
in the METAL system. It presupposes a semantic feature system and it comes 
down to the idea that the semantic value of
the PP is determined by the semantics of the preposition and the semantics
of the controlled NP which is determined by the semantics of a possibly 
present PP (e.g.\ genitive NP), definiteness and quantification type.
Via a percolation mechanism in analysis this idea can help to disambiguate
prepositions. The features used can be requirements according to which a
translation equivalent in transfer phase can be chosen.

\subsection{Preference}
Herman Caeyers and Geert  Adriaens: {\bf Efficient Parsing Using Preferences}\\
This paper describes the ordering heuristics in the current version of METAL,
a system that aims at correct (most useful w.r.t.\ postediting) and unique
translation for each sentence of a text.  The sytem has a (bottum-up) chart
parser. The heuristics consist of `static leveling' of linguistic rules and
`dynamic preferencing' of built phrases. The preference attribute of a rule
can be modified to promote or suppress a specific interpretation. With this
(not very new) mechanism the quality and the speed have been drastically 
increased.

\subsection{Issues in Analysis}
Sofia Ananiadou and John McNaught: {\bf Treatment of Compounds in a 
Transfer-based Machine Translation System}\\
The paper contains a review of work on compounds in linguistics and NLP. It 
tries to present how morphology theory is applicable to characterizing and 
representing compounds in a transfer-based 
MT system (especially some version of Eurotra) and to aiding in the development
of strategies leading to succesful handling {\em productive, (syntactically)
compositionally translatable} compounds. Some examples from Greek to English
and from Italian to Greek or English are given. Problematic are still the
A+N compounds, how to determine the correct segementations and parses, and
how to know when to synthesize a oneword compound in a language which admits
both oneword and multiword forms.\\
I think the paper does not contain any revolutionary results.\\

Chrysanne DiMarco: {\bf Accounting for Style in Machine Translation}\\
The goal of the research is to develop a method to provide MT systems with the
ability to understand and preserve the intent of an author's stylistic 
characteristics. Not only the information conveyed through the manner of
presentation must be preserved in the generated text, but it must also have a
style that is appropriate and natural to the target language. The study of 
{\em comparative stylistics} yields various stylistic differences between
languages. The paper contains examples for English and French at the lexical, 
syntactic and semantic level.
The paper focusses on a goal-directed, utilitarian group style.
The method presented consists of a vocabulary of stylistic terms, stylistic
grammars that relate the primitive and abstract elements and stylistic goals,
 and the incorporation of goal-directed knowledge.
The method is language-independent and focusses on the syntactic aspects of
style. It is implemented in a single computational system STYLISTIQUE which
could be integrated in an MT system but will then need mapping rules.\\

\subsection{Issues in Lexicography}
Dan Higinbotham: {\bf Semantic Cooccurrence Networks}\\
It is argued that approaches to lexical ambiguity that depend on selection 
restrictions (such as preference semantics) often leave a class of problems 
that are very difficult to resolve because of long distance.
Neural networks based on statistical cooccurrence may provide some hope for 
resolving lexical ambiguity in such cases. Three reported experiments seem to 
support this claim.\\

Mary Neff and Michael McCord: {\bf Acquiring Lexical Data from Machine-Readable
Dictionary Resources for Machine Translation}\\
This paper describes the direct and indirect exploitation of some monolingual 
and bilingual machine-readable resources. This is used for the lexical 
information of the English-to-German version of the
LMT system, developed by IBM. 
It turned out
that a detailed analysis of the structural properties of these resources was 
needed to extract syntactic and semantic features of words.
As the resources together  are still incomplete, a hand-coded addendum lexicon
had to be added.
For experimental reasons the lexical access component of LMT has built-in 
procedures for coordinating and mapping the various resources (slot frame 
generation)
and presenting them in a standard format. For sense disambiguation and target 
term selecting selection restrictions and a network on lexical knowledge, 
based on
synonym and taxonym dictionaries, are used. The paper contains some examples.\\
This exploitation will not only be a subsystem of the LMT project but also
an overall enterprise of acquiring a computational lexicon.\\

Gregor Thurmair: {\bf Complex Lexical Transfer in METAL}\\
The paper explains the basic outlines and changes in the transfer concept of 
METAL, because of the adding of new language pairs. It contains examples to 
show 
what kind of tests and actions have to be coped with in an MT-system, which had
consequences on the system architecture of METAL and other phenomena (like 
multiwords) and the METAL components. The rule-based translation formalism was
abandoned.
The analysis and generation of languages have to be independent of each other.
They do not believe in reversible grammars as the analysis coverage has to be 
larger than the generation  coverage. 
The METAL Interface Representation (MIR) was 
designed.
Three kinds of transfer are distinguished: 1) simple lexical transfer, 2)
structural transfer that is defined on tree properties  and 3)
complex lexical transfer that can cause structural changes, but is always 
triggered by the lexicon.
The difference between simple lexical transfer and complex lexical transfer is a
gradual one: one-to-one mapping to one-to-many mapping with disambiguating
conditions that range from local semantic information to more structural, 
concerning verb frame, prepositions, specific argument or syntactic relations.
Complex lexical transfer cannot be done locally: there are two ways to solve 
this:
1) copy down all the relevant information to the local node (short-sighted 
transfer) or 2) transfer testing at the maximal projection level (far-sighted 
transfer).  METAL is a transformational, non-declarative system. A 
subclassification of the possible actions is given: mapping operations that 
change syntactic
functions of verb arguments and peripherals (adjuncts), insertion operations
for reflexive verbs, prepositional objects etc.\ (problem: full specification 
of inserted elements),
deletion operations which are the reverse of insertion used for peripherals and
 full arguments in multiword translation and support verbs, and other operations
for turning main clauses into subordinated clauses and vice versa, explicit and
incorporated negation.
There are conditions on well-formed MIR structures. Far-sighted transfer is 
used for controllers (heads) and short-sighted transfer for controlees.
The METAL designers do not believe in a formalism that is too restrictive,
therefore they use a transformational formalism.
Consequences of the new approach are:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Multiwords are not treated as monolingual units (except for support 
verbs). They have a regular structure with idiosyncratic semantic 
interpretation that 
is dealt with in transfer in a far-sighted way.
\item generation is not influenced by the transfer problems which enhances
the feasibility of a multilingual system.
\item  with respect to user aspects: in the transfer lexicon that is accesible
to users only a reduced functionality can be offered as a certain amount
of linguistic knowledge is needed.
\end{enumerate}

It should be noted that METAL turned from a direct system into a multilingual
transfer system. The definition of the MIR that should be output of analysis

\subsection{Evaluation of MT systems}
Margaret King: {\bf A Workshop on Evaluation: Background Paper}\\
This paper was meant as a start of a discussion at the conference.\\
It is observed that there is no established methodology for the
evaluation of MT 
systems. Often evaluations are done by people who have no expertise in MT 
techniques.
So systems are judged for their current performance and not for example
for the ease of modification or extensibility.
King thinks that  public discussion of evaluation methodology  by informed 
parties will result in more honest reports and that it might do much to ensure
 that the expectations of the lay-world become realistic. The basic question 
is whether
it is possible to define a general evaluation methodology for any kind of 
system for all evaluation purposes. This seems to come down to the question if
 it would be applicable in all contexts (research, commercial products).\\
There are also different kinds of evaluation. She mentions the {\bf glass box}
 and the {\bf black box} evaluation. In the first case,
 the evaluator will know about the innner workings of the system and in the 
second, she/he will only see in- and output.\\
Criteria for evaluation are, for example, the quality of translation (but is, 
of course, very subjective) and test suites (that tend to be very large).\\
In the discussion it appeared that there are very different opinions  about
this topic varying from `only users can evaluate MT systems', `research systems
cannot be evaluated' (Nagao) to `research systems should be evaluated by their
ideas' (Des Tombe).

\section{Summary of a paper at the ACL conference}
There was only one relevant
paper about a machine translation system at the ACL-conference:\\

Bonnie Dorr: {\bf Solving Thematic Divergences in Machine Translation}\\

This paper deals with how the machine translation system UNITRAN, developed
at MIT, Cambridge, USA, solves certain translation problems, called divergences,
by taking advantage of the relationship between lexical-semantic structure and
syntactic structure. It gives an overview of certain divergence types:\\

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
\hline
divergence type & translation example\\
\hline
structural & I saw John $\leftrightarrow$ Vi a John\\
\hline
conflational & I like Mary $\leftrightarrow$ Ich habe Mary gern\\
\hline
lexical & I stabbed John $\leftrightarrow$ Le di pu\~{n}aladas a John\\
\hline
categorial & I am hungry $\leftrightarrow$ Ich habe Hunger\\
\hline
thematic & I like Mary $\leftrightarrow$ Mary me gusta a m\'{\i}\\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\ \ \\

(Conflational means incorporation of necessary participants (or arguments) of a
given action here.)\\
This paper focusses on thematic divergence. There are two types:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Reordering of arguments for a given predicate (see example above)
\item Promotion of a complement up to the main verb or demotion of the   main
verb into an adjunct position (or vice versa). Promotion is placement `higher 
up' and demotion is placement `lower down'.
For example:\\
Juan {\bf suele} [ir a casa] $\leftrightarrow$ Juan {\bf usually} goes home
\end{enumerate}
The first type of problem is solved by adding markers 
to the lexical semantic structure
(LCS) of a language  to indicate that the arguments should
be switched in the mapping to the syntactic structure in those cases where the
LCS is different from the language 
independent LCS. The second type is solved by adding PROMOTION/DEMOTION-markers
to the LCS in the same way.\\
It is striking that in the examples presented the language independent form
always happens to be the natural English one. A lot of the translation problems
presented here have been discussed in the literature to which no reference is
 made. The resemblence with old work of the GETA-team in Grenoble was pointed
out by Yorik Wilks during the discussion of this paper.\\
See also the report on the paper of Dorr at the MT-conference.

\section{Demonstration of the METAL system}
The METAL system was developed  at the University of Texas in Austin  for
English-German first. It is  supported by Siemens now and has several 
development groups in different countries.\\
The system contains an {\bf interactive lexicon environment} that can be used
by users of the system to add new lexicon entries. This environment was
shown and seemed very nice and user-friendly, but I expect that users need
to be 
trained to enter correct answers to the questions.\\
The {\bf translation system} can translate isolated sentences and yields
 only one translation.
It can translate English-German, Dutch-French (developed at
the university in Leuven, Belgium) and English-Spanish.
Translations from English into German were demonstrated. Some simple sentences
were translated correctly and the intermediate syntactic trees were shown, but
a sentence with a modal verb ({\em the woman might have been kissed by the 
man}) was
translated badly and
a rather deep preposition stranding case failed. It was disappointing that the
{\em gern/like}-case appeared not to have been implemented, although they 
claimed
to have a solution (see above). {\em Gern} (Dutch analog: {\em graag}) 
translated
into {\em gladly} and {\em like} into {\em gefallen}.\\
The demonstration was rather messy and  not very impressive.
