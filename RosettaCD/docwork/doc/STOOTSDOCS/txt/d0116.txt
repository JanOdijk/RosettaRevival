$ Document No. 0107, _Subgrammars of Rosetta3, Preliminary Version
2_, has been discussed, in particular the parts indicated by the triangles,
and some other parts that were not clear. $

$ Ad p. 8, TC: Subject-Demotionrules:$

$ - The correct translation of impersonal passives (e.g. Er werd gedanst) into
English is probably not a construction with _one_ (e.g. One is dancing), but
rather _There is dancing_, or _People are dancing_. _People_ and _one_ are
excluded in cases such as _Er werd geblaft_, but that should follow from the
type-system. What is crucial, is that something special for these constructions
where passive constructions must be translated into active constructions must
be done in this rule class$ 
$ - The Rule Class is optional in the scheme given. This is not possible if it
is necessary to translate active sentences in passive sentences, for then the
isomorphy requirement is not met. Perhaps this rule class must be obligatory,
and 'void' rules must be added for the active constructions.$

$ Ad p. 8, TC: Zich-spelling$

$ There were no objections to the approach proposed. The approach implies that
no reflexive verb can be passivized, even if this is not indicated as such in
the lexicon$

$ Ad p. 14, subgrammar EXISTENTIALPROPformation$

$ The cases that this subgrammar must be able to handle must be studied further.
Some relevant facts in this connection:$
$ How do we account for the translations er _ligt_ een boek op tafel vs.
there _is_ a book on the table; er _staat_ een boom in de tuin vs. there
_is_ a tree in the garden etc. Are these treated as existential sentences
or as locatives involving postsubj-formatie. How do we treat cases such as Het
boek _ligt_ op tafel vs. _The book is on the table_? Cases such as 
Hij _bevindt zich_ in de tuin vs. Hij is in de tuin (is _zich bevinden_
to be introduced here syncategorematically, or is _zijn_ a basic expression
in these cases ?) are also relevant in this connection.$
$ The issue consists of two parts: 1) How to choose the correct verb in Dutch
(liggen, staan, zijn). 2) How are the relevant constructions
treated, as existential constructions, or as locative constructions$
$ W.r.t. the first question it seems reasonable to account for this
by means of a type system. The second question requires further investigations.$

$ Ad p 16, Subgrammar NOUNPPROPtoNOUNPPROP$

$ - The general organization of subgrammars, and their interrelationships
have been explained. See the Scheme appearing separately. In particular,
it has been pointed out again, that the subgrammars XPPROPtoXPPROP and
XPPROPnottoSENTENCE (X = NOUN, PREP, ADJ, ADV ) are two separate subgrammars
only because the derivation from  XPPROP-s to SENTENCE-s run through
two subgrammars (XPPROPtoCLAUSE and CLAUSEtoSENTENCE) and we do not want
parts of subgrammars to correspond (w.r.t. isomorphy) to parts of other
subgrammars ( but full subgrammars to full subgrammars )$

$ It has been pointed out that since we want to be able to translate
'Ik vind hem gek' into 'Ik vind dat hij gek is', substitution of arguments
must also apply in XPPROPnottoSENTENCE subgrammars. This in itself has
as a consequence that a sentence such as 'Ik vind hem gek' is ambiguous
(has two derivations): one where the scope of the subject of the adjective
is restricted to the adjpprop, and one where the scope of this element
extends to the whole clause. It is perhaps possible to avoid this ambiguity,
but then the second one should be prohibited. Unfortunately, however,
this is the representation that (as far as I can see) assigns the correct
meaning to this sentence. More generally, we can characterize this state
of affairs as one where two sentences that are to be considered as translations
of each other, do not have exactly the same meaning (factually). The 
consequence is that, since in Rosetta  two translations of each other must 
have exactly the same meaning, the meaning assigned to one of these sentences
does not correpond (in all details) to the meaning it actually has.$

$ - The Rule Class mentioned in the Control Expression, RC: NoClauseformation,
should be RC: Clauseformation. From this rule class only rules that assign
an unmarked value for the attributes specifying tense, aspect etc. are 
relevant here. Again it should be pointed out, that the Rule Class RC: Clause
Formation is in fact not a rule class, but stands for a package of rule classes
and transformation classes that is being specified further by Lisette.$

$ Ad p. 20, TC: PropOKrules$
$ Here the subclass Infverbrules is mentioned. This class is a subset of
the TC: PROPOKrules, but it has no formal status as a transformation class
(Hence, it does not appear in the Control Expression)$

$ Ad p.21, TC: Case Assignment$
$ The general approach is adopted. However, it is assumed that NP-s start
out with  Nominative Case as the omegavalue. This will facilitate the 
local translation of NP-s. It has been discussed whether it would
be possible / desirable / necessary to have such a 'real' value as a
omega value also in other cases (e.g. infinitive for the _modus_ of verbs).
It has been proposed not to generalize this strategy automatically to other
domains, but to consider the issue in each individual case separately$

$ The assignment of Genitive Case and the introduction of the possessive marker
(GEN) in English should not be done in this rule, but in separate rules the 
NPsubgrammar.$

$ Ad p. 22 TC: PPoverV$
 
$ The interaction of members from this transformation class with the 
transformation of verb raising (from the TC: PropOKrules) is somewhat
complicated. If no special measures are taken, then it would be necessary
to have M-rules that can operate on arbitrarily deep S-trees. Several
options are available to avoid this problem. One option would be to
have the transformation class PPoverV apply successively cyclically:
the PP moves up in small steps (cf. e.g. shift rules).
Another option is to assume that the VP and the S from which a verb has been
removed by verb raising are 'pruned', so that a flat structure results, so that
PPoverV can apply normally.$
$ A similar problem occurs with the transformation NPoverAdv, and probably
also with rules that put pronouns on their correct position (e.g.

_dat hij 'm gisteren waarschijnlijk SENT[ ] V[ wilde doden]_ 
$ Furthermore, it seems that we must preclude the insertion of certain adverbs
in these infinitival complements (e.g. temporal adverbs).$ 
$ Jan Odijk will prepare a note on this subject$

$ It was pointed out that it would be easier for the linearizer if it
is possible to see which nodes are leaves by just looking at the node label 
(the category). The structure for the case of verb raising on page 23 does
not satisfy this restriction. It is decided to give the nonleave nodes that
are labeled V in the structure a different label, e.g. VN ('Verb Nonterminal').
This is probably necessary for independent reasons as well.   The surface
parser should accept right-branching subtrees only in these cases, not
left-branching ones , or  mixed-branching ones:$


OK    V                 *               V           *        V

    V   V                            V     V              V     V

      V   V                        V   V               V    V

        V     V                  V  V                     V    V



$ This effect can be achieved only by labeling nonterminal nodes in another
way than terminal nodes (cf. cf-rule V --> V V vs.  VN --> V  VN | V  V )
 
$ Ad p 24, RC: Clause Formation$
$ A choice as to how the copular verb _worden_ should be treated 
(as a basic expression, or introduced syncategorematically) depends on
the issue of how the translation of _Adj worden_ into Spanish is taken
care of. If one does so by translating the adjective (which must be
marked by some special marker to avoid 'zijn' as copula occurring with this
adjective) into the Spanish verb, then 'worden' must be introduced 
syncategorematically, and its semantics must be incorporated in the semantics
of the rule that introduces it. If one treats such cases as idioms, then 
both options are still open, in principle, and then the treatment as a basic
expression seems to be the most natural one.$
$ The translation of the verb 'worden' into Spanish should be investigated$

$ Ad p31-33, TC: Argreflspelling1/2; RC: reciprocalspelling$
$ The cases discussed here point out two problems:$
$ - The necessity for more than one meaningful rule iterating: This is
kept this way  for the time being. Depending on whether this will be
allowed in the formal definition of control expressions, this will
be kept this way, or some sort of robust way to achieve the relevant effect 
in a sufficient number of cases is adopted (e.g. iterating it a finite
number of times).$
$ - It appears impossible to treat cases where reflexive pronouns are inside
a constituent that  has scope over the antecedent of the reflexive. All
suggestions are welcome$

$ A point that should be looked into somewhat more, is the issue of where
mismatches in substitution order between two languages (cf. scope) occur, and
how they should be solved$ 

$ It has been decided to discuss doc. 111 (the interpretation of nonovert
subjects) on 11-08-86, 13.30$
