\section{Introduction}

This report covers the fourth half-year of the Rosetta project:
the period from August 1, 1986 until February 1, 1987.
Up till now the half-yearly reports to NEHEM were written in Dutch, 
but from now 
on they will be written in English, in order to make them accessible to a
larger audience.

We stick to the habit of keeping the reports brief and non-technical 
and to refer to the relevant project documents for further 
information.  
In section 2 an overview is given of the activities in the past
half-year. In section 3 we discuss some organisational aspects.
In section 4 the main Rosetta documents written in this period
are enumerated. 
In section 5 an overview is given of the person-hours spent on the
project.

\section{Activities in the period from August 1, 1986 until February 1, 1987}

We subdivide the activities into four categories: (i) formalism, (ii) software,
(iii) linguistics and (iv) miscellaneous.
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(i)]{\bf Formalism}\\
 
In the previous  report it was announced that the grammar formalism
will be extended in several ways: (i) grammars can be subdivided into
subgrammars and rule classes, (ii) a distinction is made between meaningful 
rules and purely syntactic transformations, (iii) the order of rule
application can be controlled explicitly. Definitive 
decisions on the 
formalisation of these extensions (as described in R0101, with minor 
alterations) have been made now. 

A proposal has been written concerning the notation of syntactic rules, both
for M-rules (doc. R0121) and for surface rules (doc. R0164). 
There is now a period during 
which the rule writers can make suggestions about improvements in the notation.
After this the notation will be fixed. 

\item[(ii)]{\bf Software}\\

After a relatively long period of preparatory work on software tools,
the time has come that we can profit from this in the actual 
development of Rosetta components.
 
During the actual use of our software management system RBS it turned out that  
it needed to be revised in some respects. This revision has been implemented 
and 
RBS has worked quite satisfactorily since then. The management system is 
described 
in doc. R0136.

In the previous report we mentioned the work on rule-compilers that was done 
and the decision to use our own surface-parser formalism and implementation 
as the basis for these 
rule-compilers. This approach has turned out to be very 
fruitful. The task of these rule compilers is to translate from
a rule notation into Pascal. 
It should be kept in mind that most of our rule notations contain a part that
is formulated directly in (a subset of) Pascal (e.g. assignment of values
to attributes). In the ideal case the rule compiler analyses the Pascal parts
too, but this is not absolutely necessary, because this check may be left
to the Pascal compiler. In general our strategy is to start with a rather
simple rule compiler, which does not analyse the Pascal parts, and to
extend it later if this is considered useful. 

During the past half-year a compiler was made for the domain T and for the 
surface-rules (docs. R0128 and R0164). The domain T specifies the syntactic 
categories, the 
corresponding attributes and their possible values. In addition it contains
declarations of specific subsets of categories, of copy-functions, default 
values of attributes etc. 
The current 
surface rule compiler is a simple one, which does not analyse the Pascal
parts of the rules.

After having gained experience with rule compilers it was found useful to make 
a compiler-generator, also based on the surface grammar formalism. 
There is already 
a first version of this compiler-generator (doc. R0167), 
which will be used for the 
construction of the M-rule compiler. Because of the complexity of these rules
and also because it is to be expected that their notation will 
have to be adjusted several times to the needs of the rule-writers, a 
compiler-generator will be especially useful for this, but it will also be
useful for other purposes.  

During a 3-month traineeship a computer science student 
(N. Spaen, HTS-Informatica) has developed
a user-interface for updating the basic lexicon.

For the storage of the Rosetta dictionaries we will make use of RMS, a DEC 
software package for file I/O; for this
purpose an interface between Rosetta and RMS has been made.
 
The algorithms for morphological analysis (i.e. for applying GLUE rules,
segmentation rules and lextree-rules, as specified in doc. R0065)
have been implemented.

Several tools have been developed for extracting information from the Van Dale
dictionaries. These tools make use of a syntax for the Van Dale entries that
was developed first.

\item[(iii)]{\bf Linguistics}\\

{\it Morphology}

The documentation for the Dutch and Spanish inflection rules was written in 
this period (docs. R0122, R0123, R0134, R0135). The documentation for English 
inflection had been written before. The rules have been tested for syntactic 
correctness and translated into correct Pascal 
by the rule compilers. Now that the algorithms for morphological
analysis have been implemented, the actual application of the rules can be 
tested. Small dictionaries (about 200 entries for each language) 
have been made for this purpose. 

{\it Syntax and semantics}

The studies on time and tense and on verb patterns have resulted in definitive
proposals (docs. R0053 on time and tense, new version of 
R0108 and R0168 on verb patterns).

The subdivision of the grammars into subgrammars and rule classes has been 
completed, including the definition of the control expression for each 
subgrammar (docs. R0149 - R0155, R0157, R0158, R0103, R0109). 

The next step has been the detailed definition of the domain T of possible
S-trees, i.e. the 
specification of syntactic categories, attributes, values etc. The definition 
for Dutch can be found in doc. R0141 and R0146; for English and Spanish there
are preliminary definitions.

In December 1986 the actual writing of grammar rules has started. This was two 
months later than originally planned. The detailed definition of the domains 
took more time than expected; in addition it took some time to get accustomed 
to the new notation of the rules. Especially in
the first phase feed-back is to be expected from the actual rule writing 
to the global definition of the 
subgrammars and to the definition of the domain. Furthermore we have chosen for
a strategy where for a specific subgrammar Dutch grammar rules are written 
first and then the English and Spanish grammars follow. Although all three 
languages have been taken into account during the definition of the subgrammars
and rule classes some feed-back from the English and 
Spanish grammars to the Dutch grammars is to be expected.

In September dr. J. Groenendijk, Central Interfaculty, University of Amsterdam,
started a preparatory study on text semantics, in particular on the relevance
of Kamp's Discourse Representation Theory for translation at the text level 
instead of the sentence level.

In September three trainees (students of linguistics) have started preparatory
studies: on syntax and semantics of time 
adverbials and on the use of semantic features for lexical disambiguation.


\item[(iv)]{\bf Miscellaneous}\\

The tapes of the Van Dale dictionaries Dutch-English and English-Dutch have
arrived. However, most work on dictionaries in this period 
was related to the dictionary for 
Contemporary Dutch, that we already had on tape. The before-mentioned
software tools for automatically extracting information from the Van Dales are
 used now in particular for morphological information, e.g. about 
the plural form of nouns. A lot of syntactic information needed for Rosetta is 
not at all in Van Dale or not explicit enough for automatic processing. An 
example of this is "verb patterns", information about the arguments of
verbs. It was found out that the information on verb patterns in 
Longman's English 
dictionary  is much closer to our needs (doc. R0144).   

The research in the DOOM project (ESPRIT project 415A) on making a parallel
version of Rosetta, written in the parallel object-oriented language POOL,
continues. For most of the algorithms in the analytical morphological
component POOL programs have been written now. For their actual application it 
is necessary to have POOL versions of the morphological rules too. For this 
purpose - and for other purposes as well - a Pascal to POOL compiler will be
written (this is an activity in the DOOM project, not in Rosetta).
\end{enumerate}

\section{Management aspects}

{\bf Shift of deadlines}
\bigskip
 
It has been decided to shift the deadlines for Rosetta3 with three months.
So the deadline for the Dutch-English and the Dutch-Spanish version is shifted
from February 1, 1988 to May 1, 1988 and 
the deadline for the English-Dutch and the English-Spanish version is shifted
from August 1, 1988 to November 1, 1988.
For NEHEM the consequence is that the evaluation date for the subsidy 
will become May 1, 1988. The subsidy itself expires at the end of 1987 anyway.
 
The delay can be explained formally by (1) the 5 percent 
reduction in working time (13 working days a year) 
which was introduced after the 
original planning was made, (2) the fact that 
the originally planned extension of the number
of linguists from 7 to 9 in 1987 will not be realised. 

From the point of view of the content of the work the two main reasons 
for the delay are the following. 
\bigskip

(1) In contrast with the original expectation, the 
Rosetta3 software had to be developed almost completely afresh, very little 
software could be taken over from Rosetta2. 
The main causes for this are: 

(i) Changes (improvements) had to be made 
in the formalism for morphology and 
syntax. Although these changes were rather small from a formal point of view, 
their efficient implementation had drastic consequences. 

(ii) Rosetta3 must have a much more modular structure than Rosetta2,
because of its size and because it is developed by a group
of people; this had many consequences for the implementation. 

(iii) Rosetta3 will not only be a translation system for specific 
language pairs, but also a 
translator-generator, which will enable to develop future versions of Rosetta3
and Rosetta4 more smoothly. This is a more ambitious goal than
originally planned. Mainly due to this  
the amount of work on supporting software 
(software management system, rule compilers, etc.) 
required for the development of Rosetta3 was 
larger than originally estimated. 
\bigskip

(2) We have chosen for a top-down process of grammar development. First an
inventory has been made of the linguistic facts that had to be covered. Then
the grammars and the relation between the grammars were designed schematically,
decisions were made about their 
global organisation, the division into subgrammars and rule
classes and the ordering of the rules. This is done for the three languages in
parallel. Subsequently the domain T is defined for each language separately,
this includes the definition of the set of syntactic categories, the set of
syntactic relations, the attributes corresponding to the categories and
the possible values of the attributes. Ultimately the actual writing of the
rules takes place. 
This top-down design process (with feed-back) works quite satisfactorily, but
it took more time than expected to make the step from the global design of the
grammars to the detailed definition of the domain and the rule writing.

Student-trainees:
\begin{verbatim}
N. Spaen (HTS - Informatica, Eindhoven), August 15, 1986 - January 15, 1987.  
L. Kopinga (Free University, Amsterdam), since September 1, 1986.

\end{verbatim}

A. Van Hout (Catholic University, Tilburg) finished her student-traineeship
on August 15, 1986.

Dr. J. Groenendijk (University of Amsterdam) 
started a two-year study on text-semantics, financed by
Philips Research Laboratories, on September 1, 1986.

Drs. A. Mijnhout left the project on December 31, 1986. This may cause 
an additional delay, especially for the development of the English modules. 
Her successor will start on March 1, 1987, but our experience is that it takes 
a lot of time before a linguist is settled into the project.
\bigskip

{\bf Internal organisation of the project}
\bigskip

There is a software subgroup consisting of: 
Rous (chairman), Fellinger, Leermakers,
Medema and Stevens. Medema has joined the project on August 15, 1987, 
especially 
for writing software to extract information from the Van Dale dictionaries, in
cooperation with Smit. 

The morphology subgroup and the isomorphy subgroup have now merged into one 
linguistic subgroup, currently  consisting of: Odijk (chairman), Appelo, 
De Jong, Van Munster, Schenk and Smit.
