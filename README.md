# RosettaRevival
Revival of the Rosetta MT system developed in the 80s at Philips Nat Lab

A number of folders have been set up to store what is available from the past:

* _DICTReconstruction_: an attempt by Jan Odijk (JO) to reconstruct the source dictionaries on the basis of the target dictionary files. This has been done for Dutch and English. The program to do this was written in Haskell and is also included.
* _Gridline_: Report by GridLine on the feasibility of reviving Rosetta
* _JOActivities2008_: Excel file with an overview of what was done by JO in 2008
* _Meta2GNU_: GNU Awk script to convert Metaware Pascal into GNU Pascal. This was retyped from the original version because the (very old) computer it ran on did not accept memorysticks, CD-ROMs or internet connections. So it might contain typos.
* _RBS_: Rosetta beheer Systeem
* _RosettaCD_: the contents of the Rosetta CD
