$C1 Introduction

$ In Government Binding (GB) theory four types of 'gaps'. or empty categories,
i.e. categories that dominate no audible (or visible) material are
distinguished. In this note I will discuss the issue whether and how such gaps
can and / or should be used in the Rosetta system (either Rosetta3 or Rosetta
4), and I will compare these gaps with the so-called variables of the Rosetta 2
system.$

$nl 1
$ In GB-theory, the grammar takes the following form:$ 
$RL 15

$nl 1

$nl 1
$ This is the so-called T-model. In the T-model, first so-called D-structures
are formed by means of a set rewriting rules (or by the systems that derive
these) and by lexical insertion of words. The term D-structure is inspired by
the former term 'Deep Structure'(as e.g. in Chomsky(1965)), but differs from
this in certain respects. In particular, it is 'closer to the surface' than
Aspects-like Deep Structures. From D-structures one can form S-structures by
applying a number of rules. The most important group of rules is the class of
movement rules (called 'Move alpha'), which can move any constituent anywhere
(in principle). General principles and conventions, as well as language
particular stipulations, will determine what are well-formed applications of
this general rule schema. S-structure is a level of representation that is in
certain respects comparable to the notion 'Surface Structure' from the
Aspects-model, but it differs from it in particular by the fact that it is
enriched with all sorts of 'empty categories', and hence is more remote from
the surface than 'surface structures' were.$ 
$ The levels D-structure and S-structure are representations of constituent 
structure. Since grammatical functions (such as subject, direct object etc.) 
are defined in terms of structural relations, the constituent structure is 
central relevant representation. A typical structure for a sentence is as 
indicated in (2):$
$rl 10
$um
$nl 1
       (2)
                         S'

                  COMP        S

                          NP       VP

                                V   NP PP 
$um
$nl 1
$SC ~^
$ where the COMP-node usually contains subordinate conjunctions and / or
'shifted' elements (relative pronouns, wh-phrases), where the NP to the left of
VP is the subject, and where all arguments of the verb (except the subject) are
dominated by VP.$ 
$ The level of PF is not really relevant to the purposes of this note here, so
that I will ignore it. The level of LF (read 'Logical Form') is a level argued
to be necessary in a full description of syntax and showing certain
similarities (but also differences) with standard (first order) logical
representations (e.g. quantifier-variable representations), hence the name.$ 

$ A first subdivision in the group of four gaps, that are distinguished in GB-
theory can be made if we consider their origin. Empty elements can be either
'base-generated' or be created by a movement rule. In the latter case it is
called a 'trace'. A further subdivision of empty elementrs can be represented
as in the following scheme:$
$nl 1
$RL 5
        Base-generated                      Left by movement
     
        Dummy                               NP-trace

$C2 Lexical Insertion

$ If we take a typical sentential structure created by the rewriting rules
prior to lexical insertion, we might have an example as represented in (3):
(although in more recent versions of the theory a typical tree before lexical
insertion would consist of unlabelled nodes, the labelling being a consequence
of 'projection' of the categorial features of the inserted lexical items)$

$ Here the symbols || indicate positions where lexical material might be
inserted. Notice that the insertion of lexical material is optional. So empty
elements can come into existence by simply not inserting lexical material. The
dummies represented in the tree indicated here correspond partially to the
variables in Rosetta that are used to indicate the arguments.
Thus if we have a typical representation of part of a derivation tree in
Rosetta, e.g. as in (4), then we may in principle consider the x's appearing
here equivalent to the dummies in the tree in (3):$

$C2 PRO (BIG PRO)
$nl 1
$ _PRO_ is the name for the empty subject of an infinitive. Thus it is assumed
that in sentences such as (5) all infinitives have a  subject:$ 
$nl 1
$rl 4
$hr 10,(5)a. 
 I promised to do that
$um
$hr 10,b.
 I tried to do that
$um
$hr 10,c.
 I ordered them to do that
$um
$nl 1
$ The interpretation of PRO (i.e. its reference) is determined partially by 
lexical properties of the higher verb (or adjective etc.) and partially by 
structural factors. The phenomena concerning the interpretation of PRO are 
usually called _Control Phenomena_.$
$ Two subcases for the interpretation of PRO must be distinguished:
'Obligatory Control' versus 'Nonobligatory control'. They differ in the
following respects:$
$um
$nl 1
            Oblig. Control                        Nonoblig. Control

-An antecedent for PRO must be present     - Antecedent need not be present
-Antecedent must c-command PRO             - Antecedent need not c-command PRO
-Split Antecedents for PRO excluded        - Split antecedents for PRO allowed
-Antecedent must be 'close to PRO'         - Antecedent can be 'far away'
$nl 1
$ Rosetta2 can handle only cases of obligatory control, as far as I can see.
This gives certain problems, e.g. cases of infinitival subjects without an
antecedent such as 'Het is goed om te sporten' cannot be handled. In particular
this is interesting (and problematic) in the case of 'split antecedents' in
interaction with reciprocals (_elkaar_) and reflexives and bound possessive
pronouns as e.g. in idioms: e.g. _Jan_ sprak met _Piet_ af om _elkaar_ te
helpen; _Jan_ sprak met _Piet_ af om morgen _hun_ gal maar eens te spuien. The
point is that such elements themselves do not allow split antecedents (cf. *Jan
vertelde Piet over elkaar; *Jan spuide met Piet hun gal). These facts are
accounted for easily, if it is assumed that there is an intervening element,
functioning as the subject of the infinitive, that itself does allow split
antecedents under certain conditions. 
These facts show that one cannot remove the PROVAR (= the (empty) subject of
the infinitive) before all anaphoric relations(and agreement with adjectives,
participles etc.) in the sentence have been dealt with.$ 
$nl 1
$ In Rosetta2 there is an (empty) element that is (partially) functioning as 
the PRO from generative grammar. This element, however, equals the variable
(used for relativization), and that will certainly give problems. These two
cases should be distinguished. Let us do so, and call the equivalent of PRO in
Rosetta a 'PRO-variable' (PROVAR) and a variable that is used for
relativization a 'relativization variable' (RELVAR). The following
generalizations hold:$ 
$nl 1
$hr 10,||
$ A RELVAR can appear in the subject position of an infinitive
iff an overt subject can appear here$
$um
$hr 10,||
$ A PROVAR can appear in the subject position of an infinitive
iff a covert subject can appear here$  
$um
$nl 1
$ A second possible objection to the treatment in Rosetta2 is, as pointed out
already, the fact that it might be away 'too soon' to be able to handle certain
facts correctly.$ 
$ Furthermore, it seems to me that there is no problem whatsoever to 'parse'
an empty subject of an infinitive. Since every infinitive heads a sentence,
and since every sentence contains a subject, we may simply 'parse' an 
infinitive as (empty) subject+infinitive, in addition to a parse as a 
simple infinitive without a subject ( this is necessary for the case of overt
subjects and for the case of shifted subjects) 
$nl 1
$C2 pro (little pro)
$nl 1
$ 'pro' (or 'little pro') is the name for the empty subject in languages that
do not require that a finite sentence contain an overt subject, such as Italian
and Spanish. It might be useful for certain cases in Dutch as well,e.g. under
specific conditions an overt (expletive) subject need not appear, cf. e.g. _In
de tuin werd (er) gedanst_. It behaves in all respects as a personal pronoun 
that happens to be empty. (although it does differ in certain respects from
overt pronouns). At least in the case of Spanish, it cannot disappear before
all anaphoric relations, agreement with adjectives etc. have been established.
$nl 1
$C1 Movement gaps
$nl 1
$C2 General
$nl 1
$ One reason to postulate gaps as a 'trace' of the original position of a moved
element is that in this a way an interesting generalization can be captured.
The first relevant observation concerns  movement rules: movement rules
generally move elements 'upward', i.e. the target position is 'higher' in the
structure than the source position, where the notion 'higher' is defined in
terms of the notion 'c-command'. To be more precise, we define:$
$RL 13
$nl 1
$hr 10,(6)a.
$ a _is higher than_ b iff a _c-commands_ b$
$UM
$hr 10,b.
$ a _c-commands_ b iff$
$ ||| ||i) a does not dominate b$
$ and |ii) a <> b           (redundant if dominate is reflexive)$
$ and iii) the _ceiling_ of a dominates b$
$UM
$hr 10,c.
$ b is the ceiling of a iff$
$ ||||b is the first node (counted from a) such that
$ |||||||||||||i) b dominates a$
$ ||||||||and ii) b satisfies the c-command-condition$
$UM
$hr 10,d.
$ b satisfies the c-command-condition iff b branches$
$UM
$NL 1
$ Since this restriction holds for most movement rules, we can capture the fact
that it does so for most of these rules by stating the following condition on
the relation between trace (the gap in the source position) and the NP in 
the target position:$
$NL 1
$hr 10,(7)
$ A trace must be c-commanded by its antecedent$
$UM
$NL 1
$ An interesting  generalization can now be made. For anaphors (i.e. such words
as _himself_ or _each other_) a similar restriction holds:$ 
$NL 1
$hr 10,(8) 
$ An anaphor must be c-commanded by its antecedent$
$UM
$NL 1
$ Assuming now that a trace is an anaphor, a natural assumptions since an empty
element has no intrinsic meaning, hence must derive its interpretation from
other elements in the structure, one captures the fact that movement rules are
subject to the same  restriction as are anaphors.$ 
$NL 1
$ Notice that some further interesting evidence for this hypothesis is derived
from facts that at first sight seem to be exceptions to the generalization
mentioned. In particular, we said that _most_ rules obey the restriction that
the target position must be higher than the source position, not that _all_
rules obey this restriction. In particular, the rule of indefinite subject
postposing in Dutch (and English)(e.g.'er loopt een jongen op straat'), or
extraposition of S from subject-position in English and Dutch (e.g. het is 
duidelijk dat dit zo is')maps structures of the form (9) into structures of
the form (10), where clearly the target position is lower than the source
position:$
$ 
$UC -
$BC *
$RL 4 
$nl 1                          
$hr 10,(9)
$ [/S/*XP*******VP**]$
$UM
$hr 10,(10)
$ [/S/*__**[/VP/**VP**XP*]*]$
$ ****|___________|%^$
$ *********where XP is NP/indef/ or S$
$UM
$BC |
$UC _
$NL 1
$ Now notice that these are of course exceptions to the condition that a trace
must be c-commanded by its antecedent. But notice that all these rules have the
property that some designated element must be inserted in the source position
if structures of the form (10) are to yield well-formed sentences. For
S-extraposition the designated element is _it_ resp. _het_, for indefinite NP
postponing it is _there_ resp. _er_. So, what we see is that movement to a
lower position in the sentence is possible just in case the source position is
filled with a 'dummy' pronoun. This dummy pronoun in effect erases the trace
left by the movement rule, so that the condition mentioned is not violated. In
this way, a principled reason has been supplied for the question why certain
rules can move downward, and others cannot, and why downward movement is always
accompanied by insertion of a dummy element.$ 
$nl 1
$ In Rosetta, the relevant generalization probably does not hold (it certainly 
does not in Rosetta2), if it is a relevant generalization at all in this 
framework. Even if it did hold, it would not be absolutely required to capture
this generalization in Rosetta$
$nl 1
$C2 WH-movement
$nl 1
$ The rule of wh-movement moves wh-elements or phrases containing wh-elements
into a COMP-position. The rule is comparable to the shift rules of Rosetta.
Wh-movement is a special case of syntactic movement that moves an element from
an A-position (=a potential argument-position) to an A'-position (for more
exact definitions of these notions see below). 
In GB it is assumed that the rule of wh-movement is involved in several 
phenomena, among them wh-question-formation (_Who_ did he see --?),
relativization, both in finite clauses (the man _who_ I saw -- ) and in
infinitival clauses (an idea to work on --), topicalization in English (The
man, John saw --), clefting (It was the man that John saw --), pseudo-clefting
(What John sees -- is the man), comparatives (Peter is taller than John is --),
the tough-construction (The girl is pretty to look at --), and in infinitival
purpose clauses (He bought it for his child to play with --). In some of these
phenomena it is not obvious on  the surface that wh-movement is involved, since
the wh-operators are often (sometimes even obligatorily) deleted.(cf. Chomsky
1977)$ 
$nl 1
$C3 Strong Crossover
$nl 1
Consider the facts in (11) and (12):
$RL 5
$nl 1
$hr 10,(11)a.
$ |_Who_ said that Peter had seen _him_?$
$UM
$hr 10,b.
$ *_Who_ did _he_ say that Peter had seen?$

$ |_Who_ said _he_ would leave?$
$UM
$hr 10,b.
$ *_Who_ did _he_ say would leave?$
$um
$nl 1
$ The underscored pronouns are supposed to function as variables bound by the
quasi-operator 'for which x', represented by _who_). The facts in (11) and (12)
show that under certain conditions a pronoun cannot be referentially dependent
on a wh-NP. In fact, w.r.t to these facts one can state the following
generalization:$ 
$nl 1
$hr 10,(13)
$ A pronoun cannot function as a variable bound by a WH-element if the pronoun
c-commands the source position of the wh-NP.$ 
$UM
$nl 1
$ This generalization can be accounted for by assuming that wh-movement leaves
a trace in the source position and that a wh-trace must be _locally A'-bound_.
We define the following notions:$ 
$RL 11
$nl 1
$BC *
$hr 10,(14)a.
$ a locally A'-binds b iff a A'-binds b$
$ *********************and*~_E_g | g X-binds b ***and$

$UM
$hr 10,c.
$ a binds b iff*****a c-commands b$ 
$ **************and a is coindexed with b$
$UM
$hr 10,d.
$ An A'-position is a position that is not an A-position$
$UM
$hr 10,e.
$ An A-position is a position that can receive a Thematic Role in some
structure (i.e. the subject position, object position, but not e.g. the
position where a wh-element must end up )$
$UM
$BC |
$NL 1
$ And we assume the following principle:$
$nl 1
$hr 10,(15)
$ A trace created by wh-movement must be locally A'-bound.$
$UM
$NL 1
$ Let us illustrate how the facts in  (11) and (12) follow from these
assumptions. We represent the relevant parts of the structures of these
sentences in (16) and (17)$ 
$RL 2
$nl 1
$hr 10,(16)a.
|[/S'/ _Who_|||||[/S/ _ec_  said [that Peter had seen _him_]]]?
$UM
$hr 10,b.

$UM
$hr 10,b.
*[/S'/ _Who_ did [/S/ _he_ say  [ _ec_ would leave]]]?
$UM
$nl 1
$ In these structures all underscored elements are coindexed. The notation _ec_
indicates the source position of the wh-element. This accounts for (16)a. and
(17)a. on the one hand and for (16)b. and (17)b. on the other.The analysis of
both a.-cases and of both b.-cases run fully parallel, so that we shall
discuss in fact only two cases. First, let us consider (16)a.. In (16)a. _ec_
is the source position of the wh-element, hence it must be locally A'-bound.
The only element in the structure that is in A'-position is the element _who_.
This element c-commands _ec_, it is coindexed with _ec_, hence it A'-binds
_ec_. (The ceiling of _who_ is S', and S' dominates _ec_). There is no g in the
sense of (14)a., so that _ec_ is locally A'-bound by _who_, as required. The
rest of the structure does not violate any principle mentioned, so that the
structure is well-formed. (17)a. can be accounted for in a similar way.$ 
$ Consider now (16)b. (and also (17)b).. In (16)b. _ec_ is the trace of
wh-movement. Hence it must be locally A'-bound. The only element in A'-position
in this structure is the element _who_. This element c-commands _ec_, and it is
coindexed with _ec_, so that _who_ A'-binds _ec_. Notice, however, that _ec_ is
not _locally_ A'-bound by _who_. This is so because _he_ in this structure
qualifies as a _g_ in the sense of (14)a.: _he_ c-commands _ec_ (the ceiling of
_he_ is the node S, which contains _ec_), _he_ is coindexed with _ec_, so that
_he_ binds _ec_. Furthermore, _he_ is in A-position (it is the subject of the
verb _say_), so that it A-binds _ec_. Finally, _who_ c-commands _he_ (the
ceiling of _who_, S', dominates _he_), so that _ec_ is not locally A'-bound.
(it is, in fact, locally A-bound (by _he_)). Principle (15) is violated, so
that the structure is not well-formed.$ 

$ One might consider the possibility of solving this problem by rule ordering. 
If the generalization mentioned is correct, then we might consider applying 
the rule that prohibits the pronouns to be interpreted as variables bound by
the wh-element _before applying_ _wh-movement_. If one does so, then the
wh-element is in its source position at  the moment that a rule of coreference
applies. Let us assume a Rule of Coreference:\1\$ 
$RL 3 
$nl 1
$hr 10,(18) 
$ Rule of Coreference$
$ |||||||||A pronoun cannot be coindexed with a Wh-element if this$ 
$ |||||||||pronoun c-commands the wh-element$ 
$UM
$NL 1
$ Adopting (18), and the assumption that this rule must be applied before 
wh-movement, yields the correct results for the facts mentioned. Let us 
illustrate this. In (19) the relevant structures of the sentences in (11)
are listed before the application of rule (18). The wh-elements are in their
source positions:$
$RL 3
$nl 1
$hr 10,(19)a.
|[ [ _who_ said [ Peter had seen _him_ ]]]
$UM
$hr 10,b. 
|[ [ _he_||say||[ Peter had seen _who_ ]]]
$UM
$NL 1
$ (where we ignore the auxiliary-inversion)$
$ If we first apply the Rule of Coreference to these structures, then in (19)a.
the (only) pronoun _him_ does not c-command any wh-element (the ceiling of
_him_ is the most embedded node indicated, and this node does not dominate any
wh-element), in particular it does not c-command  _who_, so that these two
elements can be coindexed. In (19)b. the (only) pronoun _he_ c-commands the
wh-element _who_ (the ceiling of _he_ dominates _who_), so that, according to
the Rule of Coreference these two elements are not allowed to be coindexed. If
they are, then the structure is ill-formed.$ 
$NL 1
$ A crucial assumption of this analysis, that does not require traces, is that
the Rule of Coreference is applied before the rule of Wh-movement. 
Unfortunately, this assumption runs into troubles with other facts, e.g. a
contrast between the sentences (20)a. and (20)b.:$
$RL 3
$nl 1
$hr 10,(20)a.
*_He_ liked the man that _John_ saw yesterday
$UM
$hr 10,b.
|Which man that _John_ saw yesterday did _he_ like
$UM
$NL 1
$ In (20)a. _he_ and _John_ cannot be coreferential, but they can in (20)b..
The problem for the analysis sketched with these sentences is that (20)b. has
a structure of the form (20)a. at the moment that the Rule of Coreference
applies, so that under this analysis it is to be expected that (20)a. and 
(20)b. behave in the same way w.r.t the interpretation of the pronoun, which,
unfortunately, they don't. The relevant structure of the sentences (20),
before the application of wh-movement are given in (21):$ 
$RL 3
$nl 1
$hr 10,(21)a.
[     [ _he_ liked the   man [that _John_ saw yesterday ]
$UM
$hr 10,b.
[ did [ _he_ like  which man [that _John_ saw yesterday ]
$UM
$NL 1
$ In both structures the pronoun _he_ c-commands the NP _John_, so that 
according to the Rule of Coreference both should be ill-formed.$
$nl 1
$ I do not see a way to account for the relevant facts here without using 
traces. But it seems that the phenomenon observed here is not so relevant
for translating purposes, since only interpretations of form are excluded,
but never forms themselves. (All the sentences given have at least one 
well-formed reading) 
$nl 1 
$C3 Weak Crossover
$nl 1
$ Consider the following facts:$
$RL 5
$nl 1
$hr 10,(22)a.
$ |_His_ mother loves _John_$
$UM
$hr 10,b.
$ *_Who_ does _his_ mother love?$
$UM
$hr 10,(23)a.
$ |_Who_ said _his_ mother loved her?$
$UM
$hr 10,b.
$ *_Who_ did she say _his_ mother loved?$
$UM
$NL 1
$ where the underscored pronouns are 'coreferential'. Again, we have a case
here where only under specific conditions a pronoun can function as a variable
bound by a wh-element. It is a different case than the strong crossover case,
because (a.o.) the pronoun does not c-command the source position of the
wh-element. The GB-account for these facts is based on the following
assumptions:$ 
$rl 12
$nl 1
$hr 10,(24)a. 
$ (Theoreme) Trace of wh-movement must be a variable \2\$
$UM
$hr 10,b.
$ A variable is an element X=[(P),F] such that  X is locally                
A'-bound, where P is a phonetic matrix (which is or is not                
present) and F <= PHI, where PHI is the set of features that                
define pronouns:{ person,number, gender,Case}.$ 
$UM
$hr 10,c.
$ Biuniqueness Condition:$
$UM
$hr 14,||
$ Every operator locally A'-binds exactly one variable and$
$ Every vbl is locally A'-bound by exactly one operator,$
$ ||||||||where wh-elements in A'-position count as operators.$
$UM
$NL 1
$ From (24)a. and (24)b. statement (15) from the section on strong crossover
can be derived.(24)a itself is a theoreme that can be derived from general
principles from LGB. Assuming that traces contain a set F <= PHI (for which
there is evidence) one can show that in all ill-formed cases from (22) and (23)
condition (24)c. is violated (more precisely, the first part of (24)c. is),
whereas nothing is violated in the well-formed structures. As we will see, the
assumption that movement rules leave traces plays a crucial part in this
account. Let us consider this in some more detail: The relevant structures are
listed in (25)-(26):$ 
$rl 6 
$nl 1
$hr 10,(25)a.
[|||||||||[ [ _his_ mother ] loves _John_ ]]
$UM
$hr 10,b.
[_who_ does [ [ _his_ mother ] love||_ec_|||]]
$UM
$hr 10,(26)a.
[ _who_|||| [ _ec_||said [[ [ _his_ mother] loved her ]]]]
$UM
$hr 10,b.
[ _who_ did [ she say||[[ [ _his_ mother] loved _ec_||]]]]
$UM
$NL 1
$ In (25)a., there is no operator, nor a variable, so that nothing is violated:
the sentence is well-formed. In (25)b. the _ec_ is an element of the form [F],
with F drawn from PHI (by assumption), and this element is c-commanded by and
coindexed with the element _who_, which is in A'-position,  and there is no _g_
in the sense of (14)a. from the section on strong crossover. Hence _ec_ is a
variable, as required  (it is the trace of wh-movement). The element _his_ is
c-commanded and coindexed with _who_, hence bound and actually locally
A'-bound, as well. Furthermore this element is of the form [P,F] with F drawn
from PHI (because it is a pronoun), so that _his_ is also a variable. Now both
_ec_ and _his_ are locally A'-bound by the operator _who_, so that the
Biuniqueness Condition is violated and the structure is ill-formed. So the
principles and definitions in (24) correctly allow the structure (25)a. and
exclude (25)b..Consider now the structures in (26). In (26)b., a case parallel
to the case (25)b., the _ec_ is a variable according to the definition given.
Furthermore, _his_ is a also variable according to the definition. Now both
variables _ec_ and _his_ are locally A'-bound by one operator, _who_, so that
_who_ locally A'-binds two variables, in violation with the Biuniqueness
condition. So (26)b. is ill-formed, and correctly so. Consider now (26)a.. In
(26)a. _ec_ is a variable: it is of the form [F] (F <= PHI), and it is locally
A'-bound by _who_. Consider now _his_. _his_ is of the form [P,F] (F<=PHI), and
it is c-commanded by and coindexed with _who_. It is, however, not a variable
according to the definition, because it is not _locally_ A'-bound. (It is
locally A-bound by _ec_). Therefore the Biuniqueness Condition is not violated,
so that the structure is well-formed. Notice how the traces play a crucial
role in this account: On the one hand they are in certain structures the
'second variable', and on the other hand, in other structures they prevent a
pronoun from being _locally_ A'-bound, so that there is no violation of
Biuniqueness. Again this is a case where both the source position and the
target position of wh-movement must be known in order to account for these
sentences.\3\$ 
$nl 1
$ Again, it is absolutely unclear to me how to account for the relevant facts 
here without using traces. But as with the strong crossover cases, again only 
interpretations of form are excluded, not forms themselves, so the same remarks
as above apply here.$
$nl 1
$C3 That-trace phenomena
$nl 1
$ Consider the following phenomena:$
$RL 4
$nl 1
$hr 10,(27)a.
|Who does John say that Peter has seen||||||?
$UM
$hr 10,b.
|Who does John say||||||Peter has seen||||||?
$UM
$hr 10,(28)a.
*Who does John say that|||||||has seen Peter? 
$UM
$hr 10,b.
|Who does John say||||||||||||has seen Peter?
$UM
$NL 1
$ The phenomena in (27) and (28) show that there is an asymmetry between the
subject and the direct object w.r.t. wh-extraction: The direct object can be
extracted both when the complementizer _that_ is present, and when it is not
present. The subject can be extracted only if the complementizer _that_ is
absent.$
$ The facts indicated here can be described in many ways. There is, however,
only one description that accounts for these facts in a principled way, i.e. by
relating it to other properties of English and Universal grammar. This account
crucially uses traces. It is based on the following assumptions:$
$rl 6
$nl 1
$hr 10,(29)a.
$ (Theoreme) Wh-movement is successive cyclic (i.e. it moves in several steps)$
$UM
$hr 10,b.
$ Wh-movement is to the COMP-position (to the left of the conjunction)$ 
$UM
$hr 10,c.
$ Elements in COMP can be deleted freely (up to recoverability)$
$UM
$hr 10,d.
$ COMP contains maximally _one_ element.$
$UM
$nl 1
$ All these assumptions are well motivated for English. Further assumptions
must be made. The exact technical details are not really relevant in this
context. The crucial idea, however, is that a gap must be 'identified' by an
element that is in the neighbourhood. Normal complements are identified by
their selectors (e.g. object by a verb, or preposition) The subject position,
however, cannot be identified by its selector (because it is separated by VP),
and hence must be identified by its antecedent. The antecedent must be very
local, i.e. in the nearest COMP. If _that_ is there, then there can be no
(empty) antecedent for the subject gap (by (29)d.), hence the sentence in
ill-formed. If _that_ is not present, then a trace-antecedent can identify the
subject gap. There are other asymmetries between subjects and objects that can
be accounted for in the same way. Consider such examples as$ 
$rl 8
$nl 1
$hr 10,(30)a.
|Peter, John saw    (Topicalization of object vs top. of subject)
$rl 8
$um
$hr 10,b.
*John|, saw Peter
$UM
$rl 2
$hr 10,(31)a.
*the man saw me bought a book  (Relativization without an overt
$um
$hr 10,b.
|the man I saw  bought a book|||||relative pronoun)
$um
$rl 2
$hr 10,(32)a.
*It was John bought a book    (Clefting without _that_)
$um
$hr 10,b.
|It was a book John bought
$um
$nl 1
$ In all these cases the object-gap is allowed, but the subject gap is not, 
because it cannot be identified. If an element that can identify the gap is
introduced, the sentences become grammatical again. Introduction of an
'identifier' is impossible in the case of topicalization, but possible in the
cases of relativization (by a relative pronoun: _who_ or _that_) or clefting
(_that_).$ 
$nl 1
$ There are many (ad-hoc) ways of excluding the relevant sentences. It seems
that traces are not really required absolutely. Without traces, however, it is
not clear whether we can account for these facts uniformly. 
$nl 1
$C3 Wanna-contraction
$nl 1
$ There is a rule in English, that applies optionally, and contracts the two
forms _want_ and  _to_ into _wanna_. This rule can apply only if _want_ and
_to_ are adjacent:$
$rl 5
$nl 1
$hr 10,(33)a.
|I _want_ Peter _to_ leave
$um
$hr 10,b.
*I _wanna_ Peter leave
$um
$hr 10,(34)a.
|I _want_ _to_ leave     
$um
$hr 10,b.
|I _wanna_ leave
$um
$nl 1
$ This rule of contraction must apply rather 'late' in a generative system,
e.g. after the application of morphological rules, since it must 'see' that
the form is _want_, and not _wants_ or _wanted_. (i.e. the suffixes must have
been spelled out on the verb form). In this way one can account for the
contrast between (35) and (36), and for the non-ambiguity of (37)c. (only
interpretation (37)a.):$ 
$RL 6
$nl 1
$hr 8,(35)
|I  wanna leave
$um
$hr 8,(36)
*He wanna leave
$um
$hr 10,(37)a.
|I want   to leave
$um
$hr 10,b.
|I wanted to leave
$um
$hr 10,c.
|I wanna leave
$um
$nl 1
$ An interesting phenomenon w.r.t this contraction rule is 1) that in certain
cases it is, quite unexpectedly, blocked and 2) that it reduces ambiguity in
certain cases. Consider the following facts:$
$rl 5
$nl 1
$hr 10,(38)a.
|Who do you _want_ _to_ go away?
$um
$hr 10,b.
*Who do you wanna go away
$um
$hr 10,(39)a.
|Who do you want to leave? ( _who_ is subj or obj of _leave_)
$um
$hr 10,b.
|Who do you wanna leave?   ( _who_ is obj of leave)
$um
$nl 1
$ The generalization behind these facts is simple:$
$RL 3
$nl 1
$hr 10,(40)
$ Wanna-contraction is possible if _want_ and _to_ are adjacent,
and the subject of the infinitive introduced by _to_ is not 
the source position for a WH-phrase appearing in the structure$ 
$um
$nl 1
$ The generalization (40) is accounted for immediately by assuming that
wh-movement leaves a trace. Under that assumption the relevant structures of
(38)-(39) are given in resp (41), (42) (for the reading where _who_ is the
direct object of _leave_) and (43) (if _who_ is the subject of _leave_):$ 
$rl 3
$nl 1
$hr 10,(41)
_Who_ do you want [ _ec_ to go away  ]
$um
$hr 10,(42)
_Who_ do you want [||||to leave _ec_ ] 
$um
$hr 10,(43)
_Who_ do you want [ _ec_ to leave||||]
$um
$nl 1
$ The rule of wanna-contraction cannot apply in (41), because _want_ and _to_
are not adjacent (the trace _ec_ intervenes). This rule can apply in (42),
since _want_ and _to_ are adjacent here. Hence the string (39)b. allows a
reading where _who_ functions as the object of the infinitive. The rule cannot
apply in (43), because _want_ and _to_ are not adjacent (the trace _ec_
intervenes), so that the string (39)b. does not have a reading where _who_
functions as the subject of the infinitive clause.\4\ $ 
$nl 1
$ There are some ways to account for the relevant facts without using traces.
One might formulate an M-rule that assigns to the verb 'want' the value _true_
for the attribute MUSTBECONTRACTED (mbc). This rule is 'ordered' before the
shift rules and it applies iff it is adjacent to _to_ (which must be present at
that moment), or at least when no RELVAR or overt phrase intervenes (An
intervening PROVAR must be allowed). In the morphology there is a rule that
turns _want to_ with the attribute MUSTBECONTRACTED=true into _wanna_, and that
leaves _wants to_ or _wanted to_ with the same attributevalue unchanged. This
is a 'dirty' solution, because it yields ambiguities that do not exist (_He
wanted to leave_  is a contracted and a non-contracted form), and it requires
an attribute (MUSTBECONTRACTED)that is necessary for _want_ only. See Appendix
1 for an elaboration of such a proposal. 
In an alternative solution one would have to complicate the shift-rules: they
should mark that _want_ is not contractible anymore. Again, this is not a
beautiful solution: It complicates the shift rules considerably, and it does so
for phenomena that intuitively do not belong in this rule.$
$ Furthermore, there is an objection of a more conceptual nature. What has been
done in the appendix is in fact that the task of a morphological rule is
duplicated in the form of an M-rule. Apart from the fact that we now have in
fact two types of rules for one phenomenon (to avoid the 'global' character of
the relevant conditions), it is unclear what the meaning of the 
wanna-contraction rules is, and how isomorphy between grammars can be 
guaranteed in a nontrivial manner (i.e. not by allowing the identity or
empty operation).
$nl 1
$C3 Auxiliary-Reduction
$nl 1
$ In English certain (auxiliary or copular) verbs have two variants for certain
inflected forms, e.g. the verb _to be_ has both _is_ and _'s_ as a third 
person singular present tense form. Similarly we have _am_ and _'m_, _are_ and
_'re_; _have_ and _'ve_; _will_ and _'ll_ etc.$
$nl 1
$ In many cases both forms can be used:$
$SC ^~
$nl 1
$hr 10,(44)a.
|Peter is / 's leaving.
$um
$hr 10,b.
|Where is / 's Peter
$um
$nl 1
$ The reduced form is excluded in certain cases:$
$nl 1
$hr 10,(45)a.
|I don't know where Peter is / *'s.
$um
$hr 10,b.
|John is taller than Peter is / *'s
$um
$hr 10,c.
|Who is in the room? John is / *'s
$um
$nl 1
$SC \/
$ This is not due to stress rules (that might state e.g. that _is_ in the 
structures indicated receives obligatorily stress, hence cannot reduce), since 
in all three cases mentioned the normal stress is on the NP preceding _is_.
The relevant generalization can be stated as in (46):$
$nl 1
$hr 10,(46)
$ A verbal form can be reduced unless in an earlier stage of the 
derivation it immediately preceded an element that is not there anymore
now.$
$um
$SC ^~
$nl 1
$ Thus in (45)a. _is_ was followed by _where_ at some stage in the derivation,
and _where_ is not in its original position anymore, so that the unless-clause
of (46) applies, and _is_ cannot be reduced. In (45)b. _is_ was followed by a
wh-element at an earlier level (cf. Chomsky 1977), which is not there anymore,
so that reduction is excluded. And in (45)c. the auxiliary _is_ was followed
by a copy of the VP from the first sentence in an earlier stage of the 
derivation, which is not there anymore, so that reduction cannot apply.$
(cf. also ...who he is / *'s, he has read the book that I have / *'ve, A man
he is / *'s, It's a man I am / *'m, What he is / *'s is a man)
$nl 1
$SC \/
$ The generalization (46) is a 'global' condition in the sense that it refers 
to two different stages of the derivation, a type of globality that one would 
like to avoid (it cannot be stated in the Rosetta framework, as far as I can 
see). If it is assumed that movement rules leave a gap in the source position,
then we can reformulate (46) in a way that avoids the kind of globality 
mentioned:$
$nl 1
$hr 10,(47)
$ A verbal form can reduce unless it immediately precedes a gap.$
$um
$nl 1
$ The formulation (47) does not only avoid the globality mentioned, but can be 
motivated independently, since one can argue that the interpretation of left
out VP's (as in (45)c.) should not be accounted for by deletion of a full VP,
but by interpretation of an empty VP: [/VP/ gap ]. (Cf. Sag(1976); 
Williams(1977)). If this is so, then (47) predicts that such left out VP's will
block reduction, whereas (46) does not predict this (perhaps even the
opposite). Since left out VP's do block reduction, (47) must be preferred to
(46).$ 
$nl 1
$ This phenomenon can be accounted for without traces by complicating the
shift-rules, a possible VP-deletion rule (or an equivalent) etc. and ordering a
Reduction Rule in the M-rules ( although, clearly, this is a very inelegant
solution).(See appendix 2).$
$ The same conceptual objection as to the 'solution' of wanna-contraction holds
here: In fact the task of a morphological rule is duplicated in the form of a
M-rule. It is therefore not clear what the meaning of this rule would be
(probably zero-meaning), and what corresponding M-rules there would be in
grammars of other languages (except the identity-operation)$ 
$nl 1
$C2 NP-MOVEMENT
$nl 1
$ NP-movement is the name for the rule that moves elements (in particular NP)
from an A-position into some other A-position. The target position is always
a subject-position, in the GB-framework. The source-position can bear any 
grammatical function. The rule is involved in passives, where it puts the
direct object, indirect object, prepositional object or embedded subject
into the subject position (cf. e.g. The book has been read --, He is given 
-- the book,The program has been looked at --, he is believed -- to be a
thief), with so-called raising verbs, where it puts the embedded subject into
the higher subject-position (cf. He seems -- to be a thief), and with a class 
of intransitive verbs of which it is assumed that they take a direct-object,
that must become a subject in the course of the derivation (e.g. French ils
sont arriv'%es --)$ 
$nl 1
$C3 Prenominal Passive Participles
$nl 1
$ Two types of passives must be distinguished: _adjectival_ passives and
_verbal_ passives (cf. Wasow(1978)). It can be well-motivated, and is assumed
in all theories that _adjectival_ passives (i.e. passive participles of
category ADJ) must be formed in the lexicon by a morphological rule, that
relates two lexical items. In particular, an adjectival passive takes an
argument in subject-position, with thematic role _theme_.$
$ In GB(but not in some other theories. e.g. LFG) it is assumed that _verbal_
passives contain a trace in their syntactic descriptions. 
Williams (1982) supplies us with an argument for the assumption that in the
case of verbal passives the syntactic description contains a trace.
The argumentation is as follows: There is a constraint on prenominal 
modifiers (holding in English and German (and Dutch,JO)), that states that a
prenominal modifier must end in its head (_H_ead _F_inal _F_ilter)(. Cf. the
examples in (48), where the head is underscored in all cases:$ 
$nl 1
$RL 3
$hr 10,(48)a.
|The [_proud_] man
$um
$hr 10,b.
*The [_proud_ of his children] man
$um
$hr 10,c.
*The [_to_ Bill] letter
$um
$nl 1
$ The cases b. and c. are illformed because the heads of the prenominal
modifiers are not final in the modifying phrase. Since in German (and in Dutch)
the verb in clausal structures is final, and since the verb is the head in
prenominal modifiers such as in (49), German and Dutch allow prenominal
modifiers that are considerably more complex than in English:$ 
$nl 1
$RL 3
$hr 10,(49)a.
|Der [seine Pfeife _rauchende_] Mann
$um
$hr 10,b.
|De [op straat _lopende_] jongen
$um
$nl 1
$ In German and Dutch certain complements can appear both before and behind a
verb, e.g. the PP _op zijn vader_ in (50):$
$nl 1
$RL 3
$hr 10,(50)a.
|Hij zei dat hij _op zijn vader_ wachtte
$um
$hr 10,b.
|Hij zei dat hij wachtte _op zijn vader_
$um
$nl 1
$ As predicted, using the order of (50)b. in a prenominal modifier yields 
ungrammaticality, whereas using the order of (50)a. yields no problems 
whatsoever:$
$nl 1
$RL 3
$hr 10,(51)a.
|De [ op zijn vader _wachtende_] jongen
$nl 1
$um
$hr 10,b.
*De [ _wachtende_ op z'n vader ] jongen
$um
$nl 1
$ Now consider the case of passives. If verbal passives contain a trace in
their syntactic description, then this trace will always follow the verbal
form in English, so that the verbal form itself can never be final in a
prenominal modifier (so that it will be ungrammatical in all cases. This
prediction is borne out:$ 
$nl 1
$RL 3
$hr 10,(51)a.
|the promised book     (adjectival passive)
$um
$hr 10,b.
*the promised man      (verbal passive, cf. The man was promised a book)
$um
$hr 10,c.
|the told story        (adj. pass)
$um
$hr 10,d.
*the told people       (verb. passive, cf. he was told)
$um
$nl 1
$ Hence verbal passives contain a trace in their description. (Williams
discusses some alternative accounts, and rejects them, and he supplies some
independent evidence for the distinctions between verbal passives and
adjectival passives he makes).$
$ This argument is weak, however, since the verbs that illustrate the point
require a direct object as one of their arguments. Since this  direct object is
not present, the relevant examples are simply wrong because an obligatory 
argument is missing (or if this argument is present, though empty, then the
structures are ill-formed by the HFF, but not crucially because of the trace
left by NP-movement).$
$ Nevertheless, if we extend this analysis to ergatives, notice that it is
predicted that prenominal ergative participles should now be ill-formed in
English (prenominal modifier ends in trace of NP, hence not init head), but not
in Dutch ot German (because of SOV). I have not really investigated this, but
some first facts seem to indicate that this might be correct. Cf.$ 
$nl 1
              Dutch                           English

       de [ t gekomen    ] man             *the [come    t ] man
       de [ t overleden  ] man             *the [died    t ] man
       de [ t vertrokken ] mensen          *the [left    t ] people
$nl 1
$ It must, however, be assumed then, that in cases like _the fallen leaf_,
_the broken window_, the _opened window_, _fallen_, _broken_ and _opened_
are adjectives. This is independently necessary for _broken_ and _opened_,
but it is unclear whether it can be motivated for all cases.$
$nl 1
$ In Rosetta we might use the condition that prenominal modifiers must have
their head in final position as a filter to block wrong cases, or as a trigger
to postpone the prenominal modifier. We do not really need traces in Rosetta
for this purpose, since we can refer to the more superficial generalizations
that can be stated in terms of categories and in terms of verb classes (i.e.
prenominal modifier is well-formed if head is final, and head does not belong
to the class {passive part. of ergative verb, passive participle of transitive
verb }). We must guarantee, however , that all adjectival participles are in
the lexicon$

$C3 Raising verbs and bound anaphors

*Zij lijken elkaar voor de kinderen te zorgen

$SC ^~
$hr 10,b. 
*Zij lijken elkaar intelligent

$SC \/
$nl 1
$ The ill-formedness is caused in all these cases by the presence of the 
bound anaphor (_elkaar_). If we leave this element out, as in (53), or replace
it by a pronoun, as in (54), then the relevant sentences are well-formed:$ 
$nl 1
$hr 10,(53)a.
|Zij lijken voor de kinderen te zorgen

|Zij lijken me voor de kinderen te zorgen
$um
$hr 10,b.
|Zij lijken mij intelligent

$ The fact that bound anaphors cannot appear here as an indirect object is a
pecularity of the verb _lijken_, since with other verbs a bound anaphor can
appear as an indirect object, e.g. 'Zij beloofden _elkaar_ voor de kinderen te
zorgen'. The fact that the bound anaphor cannot appear with some verbs, but can
with others can be related to another difference between the relevant  verbs:
the subject position of _beloven_ requires an argument, but the subject
position of _lijken_ does not. One can see this in the examples (55), where the
subject-position of this verb is filled by the dummy-element _het_, which
cannot be replaced by the sentence:$

$ (For some further evidence, see below) Now let us assume the following: for
every verb it is specified how many arguments it takes, where these arguments
must be (subject-position, object- position etc.) and what their categorial
nature must be (NP, PP etc). For every argument the verb requires it assigns a
thematic role to _a certain position_. We require that there is a biunique
relation between thematic roles and arguments:$ 
$RL 4
$nl 1
$hr 10,(56)
$ |Theta-Criterion:$
$ ||||Every argument is assigned one Thematic role||||and$
$ ||||Every thematic role is assigned to one argument  $
$um
$nl 1
$ The fact that _lijken_ allows the dummy element _it_ in the 
subject-position, and the fact that it does not allow its sentential
complements in subject-position, suggests that _lijken_ have
the following lexical specification:$
$um
$nl 1
$hr 10,(57)
$ _lijken_||: Thematic Roles      : 2; (dir obj and ind obj)$
$ ||||||||Categorial Selection: -- (NP){AP,S}$
$um
$nl 1
$ In particular, _lijken_ does _not_ assign a Thematic role to the
subject-position. (Again, see below for some further evidence for this
assumption). On the other hand, the verb _beloven_ is triadic, and more in
particular, it assigns a Thematic Role to the Subject-position:$ 
$nl 1
$hr 10,(58)
$ _beloven_ : Thematic roles||||||: 3 ; 1 to dir.obj; 1 to indir. obj;$
$ ||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||1 to subj;$
$ ||||||||||Categorial Selection: -- (aan)NP {S,NP}$
$um
$nl 1
$ Now consider the sentence 'Zij beloven me voor de kinderen te zorgen'. In
this sentence there appear the following arguments:$ 
$rl 4
$nl 1
$hr 10,||
$ _zij_||: receives a Thematic Role from _beloven_ (subj)$
$ _me_|||: receives a Thematic Role from _beloven_ (indobj)$
$ _infS_ : receives a Thematic Role from _beloven_ (dirobj)$
$um
$nl 1
$ and of course within the embedded sentence there are arguments, but these
we will ignore here. The verb promise has assigned all  of its (three) Theta-
roles, so that the 0%--criterion is satisfied.$
$ Consider now, in contrast, the sentence (54)a.. It contains the following 
arguments:$
$nl 1
$hr 10,||
$ _zij_||: receives a Theta Role from ????$
$ _me_|||: receives a Theta role from _lijken_ (ind obj)$
$ _infS_|: receives a Theta Role from _lijken_ (dir obj)$
$um
$nl 1
$ The interesting Case is of course _zij_. _zij_ is an argument, hence it
requires a Theta Role, but it is not in position where it can receive a
Theta Role. Now it can be argued convincingly that _they_ has been moved
from the subject position of the embedded infinitive to the subject position
of the higher sentence, i.e. the structure for sentence (54)b. has been subject
to a rule that converts (59)a. into (59)b.:$
$nl 1
$rl 3
$hr 10,(59)a.
|---- lijken mij [ zij||voor de kinderen te zorgen ]
$um
$hr 10,b.
|zij||lijken mij [ ---- voor de kinderen te zorgen ]
$um
$nl 1
$ Now one might use the fact that _zij_ was in a position where a Theta-
role can be assigned in structure (59)a., so that it has picked up its
theta role already before it ends up in the subject position of _lijken_.
There is however an alternative, i.e. suppose that we assume that movement
rules leave a trace, coindexed with its antecedent. And suppose that an 
argument can satisfy the theta criterion if it can be 'linked' somehow
(in a way to be made precise) to an argument position, and that it violates
the theta criterion if it is not 'linked' to an argument in this sense. Then
we account for the same facts, but also, as I shall show, for the mysterious
facts in (52).$
$ Let us assume that movement leaves a trace that is coindexed with the
element moved. Furthermore, let us define the notion of _chain_ (cf. Chomsky
1981:333):$ 
$nl 1
$hr 10,(60)
C = (a/1/,a/2/,...,a/n/) is a chain iff
$um
$hr 14,(i)
a/1/ is a NP
$um
$hr 14,(ii)
FORALL i<n  a/i/ locally A-binds a/i+1/
$um
$hr 14,(iii)

$um
$hr 14,||
|||||||||(b) a/i/ is A-free
$um
$hr 14,(iv)
C is maximal
$um
$nl 1
$
Not all details of this definition are directly relevant in this context.
Let us assume furthermore that the Theta criterion is satisfied iff (i) every
chain contains exactly one argument, and (ii) every theta-role has been 
assigned one theta role, and (iii) every theta role has been assigned to
one chain, where furthermore we say that a theta role has been assigned to a 
chain iff a theta role is assigned to a position in the chain. Given these
definitions, let us apply them to the relevant structures. These are
represented in (61): b. <--> (53)a., d. <--> (52)a.$

$ where _t_ represents the trace of movement of _zij_ , ,PRO represents the 
embedded (empty) subject of the embedded sentence, and underscoring of two or
more constituents indicates their being coindexed. Furthermore, _t_ is a
nonprononimal anaphor, PRO is pronominal anaphor. 
Consider first (61)a. In this structure _zij_ and _PRO_ are coindexed,
and in fact _zij_  locally A-binds _PRO_. _PRO_, however, is a pronominal
empty category (hence does not satisfy (60)(iiia)) and it is not A-free
(since it is A-bound by _zij_) so that it does not satisfy (60)(iiib) either.
As a consequence, _zij_ and _PRO_ are in different chains, as required, since
a Theta-role is assigned to both positions occupied by them.
Consider now (61)b. In this structure there is a chain (zij, t), as one
can show quite easily: _zij_ is a NP, as required by (60)(i). _zij_ locally
A-binds _t_, as required by (60)(ii); _t_ is a non-pronominal empty category
(so it satisfies (60)(iiia), hence (60)(iii)). The chain (zij,t) is maximal,
as required by (60)(iv), and it is of the format (a/1/,a/2/,..a/n/). Since
_zij_ and _t_ are in one chain, only one of the positions they occupy must
receive a Theta Role (otherwise the Theta criterion will be violated). This is
indeed the case, because the position _zij_ occupies does not, but the 
position _t_ occupies does receive a Theta Role (cf. the lexical properties
mentioned above).$
$ Consider now the sentences (61)c. and d. The contrast between c. and d. can
be accounted for quite easily. In (61)c. there are two chains consisting of
one element each. These chains are (zij) and (elkaar). They do not form
one chain because _elkaar_ is neither a nonpronominal empty category
(60)(iiia) nor A-free (60)(iiib) (it is A-bound by _zij_). Of course, they
should not form one chain, because to both positions a Theta Role is assigned.
The third theta role of the verb _promise_ must be assigned to the embedded
sentence, which cannot be done directly using the definition of chain given
(due to the requirement that the first element of the chain be a NP).
Since it is irrelevant in this context, I will ignore this problem here. Given
this proviso, the Theta Criterion is satisfied in (61)c..$ 
$ Consider now the structure (61)d. In this structure, according to the 
definition of chain as given, there are two chains:(zij) and (elkaar, t).
(elkaar, t) is a chain because it is of the required format, a/1/ =
_elkaar_ is an NP (60)(i)); _elkaar_ locally A-binds _t_ (60)(ii));
_t_ is a nonpronominal empty category (60)(iiia) hence (60)(iii)); and C
is maximal, i.e. (zij, elkaar, t) is not a chain (because _elkaar_
does not satisfy (60)(iii)); Similarly (zij), is a chain. Crucially, of
course (zij, t) does not form a chain. Given the two chains (zij) and
(elkaar, t), the theta criterion is violated: to the position occupied
by _zij_ no Theta role is assigned, so that the chain (zij) is not assigned 
a theta role, so that the Theta Criterion is violated; to both positions 
_elkaar_ and _t_ a theta role is assigned, so that the chain (elkaar, t) is
assigned two theta-roles, again violating the Theta Criterion. Notice that one
might try to save the structure by not coindexing _elkaar_ with _zij_
Then there would be  one chain (zij, t), as required (again ignoring the
embedded S). But if _elkaar_ is not coindexed with _zij_, then it violates
the principle that a reciprocal must have an antecedent. So this will not save
the structure.$ 
$ Generalizing this particular case to a more general statement:$
$nl 1
$rl 10
Given a structure containing three elements, _ant_, _ana_, and _gap_ where    
    1) ant c-commands ana and 
       ana c-commands gap
and 2) ant, ana and gap are coindexed
and 3) ant, and gap are in A-positions
and 4) ant is in 0%-'-position and
       gap is in 0%--position    
and 5) gap is empty                    
$nl 1
$ the structure is ill-formed.$
$ An interesting phenomenon is the fact that the corresponding sentences in 
English are grammatical!! (cf. Chomsky 1981:43, who gives _They seem to each
other to be happy_). The reason for the difference between Dutch and English
might be found in the fact that the indirect object of _seem_ does _not_ 
c-command the infinitival complement (so no elements in it either) in English,
(as argued for by Aoun (1980:...), whereas the indirect object of _lijken_
does c-command the infinitival complement in Dutch. Notice that there is a
translation problem here (in the direction English-->Dutch)\5\$
$nl 1
$SC ^~
$ There are two points relevant to Rosetta. First, how should verbs like 
_lijken_, _schijnen_ and _seem_ be treated, and second, do we want to exclude
the sentences discussed?, and if so, how? As to the first point,it seems that a
'raising'-analysis is most adequate. A raising analysis assumes that the
subject of 'seem' starts as a subject of the infinitive and that it is
'shifted' to become the subject of seem: [ head/seem [ subj/he head/to come
]]==> [ subj/he head/seem [ head/ to come ]]. Such an analysis accounts
adequately for the fact that a verb like 'seem' imposes no selection
restrictions on its subject (i.e. the subject of 'seem' can be of any 'type')
on its subject: It can be any referential NP: (John seems to come), any
nonreferential NP: (wheather-it: (it seems to rain); expletive-it: (it seems to
be unclear whether he comes); expletive-there: (there seem to be three men in
the room); idiom-chunks (care seems to have been taken; het bijltje schijnt er
bij neergegooid te zijn;) and such an analysis accounts adequately for the fact
that selectional restrictions that are imposed on the subject of _seem_ are
imposed by the infinitive subordinate to _seem_$
$SC \/ 
$ As to the second point, let us assume that we want to exclude the relevant 
sentences. We might exclude them in Rosetta by stipulating the generalization
that holds w.r.t these examples, i.e. that certain verbs ('raising verbs') do
not allow an anaphor as their indirect object in Dutch.

$C3 Interaction with clitics
$nl 1
$ The argument for NP-trace in this section can be derived from certain facts 
in Italian or French, and probably Spanish as well. It involves the 
interaction between passivization and anaphoric clitics. The argument is 
similar to the argument given in the preceding section.
    In Italian the verb _presentar_ ('to introduce')can be passivized: 
$nl 1
$RL 2
$hr 10,(62)
|Sono presentati
$um
$hr 10,||
|'They are introduced'
$um
$nl 1
$ An indirect object can be present, and it can contain an bound anaphor, e.g.
the reciprocal and reflexive element _se stesso_ 'himself, 'each other':$
$nl 1
$RL 2
$hr 10,(63)
|Sono presentati a se stesso
$um
$hr 10,||
|'They have been introduced to each other'
$um
$nl 1
$ Normally, instead of the element _se stesso_ the clitic element _si_ can
appear, with the same meaning as _se stesso_:$
$nl 1
$RL 2
$hr 10,(64)
|Si sono presentati gli amici
$um
$hr 10,||
|They have introduced  to each other the friends'
$um
$nl 1
$ If, however, the verb is  passivized, then the variant with the clitic _si_
is excluded:$ 
$nl 1
$RL 2
$hr 10,(65)
*Si sono presentati
$um
$hr 10,||
|They have been introduced to each other
$um
$nl 1
$ This can be accounted for in the same way as in the preceding section if it
is assumed that the movement of the NP from object position to the subject 
position that is involved in passivization leaves a trace. Under that
assumptions, the relevant structures for the sentences (62)-(65) are indicated
in (66)a.-d., where _pro_ stands for _little pro_ (see above):$ 
$nl 1
$RL 4
$hr 10,(66)a.
|pro/i/ sono presentati ec/i/
$um
$hr 10,b.
|pro/i/ sono presentati ec/i/ a se stesso/i/
$um
$hr 10,c.
|pro/i/ si/i/ sono presentati gli amici 
$hr 10,d.
*pro/i/ si/i/ sono presentati ec/i/
$um
$nl 1
$ Case (66)d. is excluded because the chains that can be formed are (pro/i/),
and (ec/i/), where the first of these chains contains an argument (_pro_)
but no position to which a -%0-role is assigned, and where the second of 
these chains does not contain an argument, but does contain a -%0-position.
The clitic _si_ in this sentence intervenes between the gap and the subject in
an A'-position, so that the gap is not _locally_ A-bound.\6\
In all other structures all chains either  consist of one argument in a -%0-
position, or are of the form (pro, ec).$
The facts here are in fact a special case of the more general configuration 
described above (with ant = _pro_, ana = _si_, gap = _ec_).

$C2 Movement at LF
$nl 1
It is assumed in REST that S-Structure is turned into LF by a number of rules,
among them a number of movement rules. These movement rules leave traces.
Traces play a crucial role in LF to account for certain facts. Basically,
traces function as variables bound by an operator at LF (with some 
qualification concerning Reconstruction, see below).
As far as Rosetta is concerned, traces created after S-structure pose no
problems whatsoever, since they do not influence the surface string. Whether
the type of operations and representations used at LF are necessary or useful
in Rosetta can be determined on other grounds.
$nl 1
$C3 QR and Strong Crossover
$nl 1
$ One of the rules that applies between S-Structure and LF is the rule of 
Quantifier Raising (QR). This rule moves a quantified phrase from an 
A-position and adjoins it to the nearest S-node. It leaves a trace in the 
source position,that is coindexed with the quantified phrase and that functions
as a variable at LF. In this way a representation results that looks like a
quantifier-variable representation from logic. A 'quantified phrase' is a
phrase that contains a quantifier (in the Determiner position, or as a head).
The following example illustrates the rule of QR:$ 
$nl 1
$hr 10,(67)a.
$ John saw every man$
$um
$hr 10,b.
$ [/S/ [Every man]/i/ [/S/ John saw ec/i/ ]]$
$um
$nl 1
$ Since the rule of QR applies at LF, one does not see the effects of this rule 
directly at the surface (cf. the T-model ). The evidence for the existence of 
this rule comes from the fact that$
$nl 1
$hr 10,(68)
$ Quantified phrases behave like WH-phrases w.r.t. strong and weak 
crossover$
$um
$nl 1
$ A crucial part in the account for the strong and weak crossover phenomena
w.r.t WH-phrases was played by 1) taking into account that the wh-elements had
been moved into COMP-position and 2) by assuming that the movement rule had 
left a trace. If we assume the same in the case of quantified phrases, then we
can account for the relevant facts by the same principles. The case of strong 
crossover does not supply any real evidence for the rule of QR, since one can
account for these facts as well by referring to S-Structure alone (assuming
that Quantified Phrases behave like names w.r.t binding). Clear evidence is
supplied by Weak Crossover:$ 
$nl 1
$C3 QR and Weak Cross-over

$hr 10,(70)a.
|_John_ loves _his_ mother
$um
$hr 10,b.
|_Every boy_ loves _his_ mother
$um
$nl 1
$ These sentences show that in certain cases where a coreferential reading 
between a name and a pronoun is allowed ((69)a.,(70)a.), a reading of the
pronoun as a variable bound by the quantified NP is not ((69)b.), whereas in
other cases this is possible ((70)b.). The generalization behind these
facts can be stated as in (71):$ 
$nl 1 
$rl 4
$hr 10,(71)
$ A pronoun and a quantified NP (QP)cannot be 'coreferential' iff$
$ a. The pronoun is bound by  QP in the gc of the pronoun|||||or$
$ b. The pronoun c-commands the QP (at S-S)|||||||||||or$
$ c. The QP does not c-command the pronoun$
$um
$nl 1
$ where the _gc(governing category) of the pronoun_ is (simplifying somewhat)
the sentence the pronoun appears in.$ 
$ This generalization follows in full if the rule of QR is assumed, and if it is
assumed that The Bijection Principle applies at LF. For the latter assumption 
there is independent evidence (see below). Notice that we have put the notion
_coreferential_ in (71) between quotes, because a quantified NP, strictly 
spoken, does not have a reference. The intention here is, as before: a pronoun
can be interpreted as a variable bound by the quantified NP.$ 
$ The generalization (71) can be derived in the following way: the parts a. and
b. are the cases where coreferentiality between a pronoun and a name is 
impossible as well, so that these cases are accounted for by the principles 
that account for that fact (Binding Theory B and Binding Theory C resp.). The 
relevant part is (71)c. This part of (71) can be derived as follows (under 
the crucial assumption that QR exists). If the QP does not c-command the 
pronoun, then QR leaves a trace that does not c-command the pronoun. If the
pronoun is coindexed with QP, then QP locally binds two elements in this case,
viz. the gap it left by the application of QR and the pronoun. In that case, 
however, the Bijection Principle is violated, so that the structure is ill-
formed. To illustrate this, we will represent the LF-forms of the sentences
(69) and (70) in (72):$
$nl 1
$hr 10,(72)a.
|[/S/ [/NP/His/i/ mother] loves John/i/]

applies at LF will be supplied below, in the section on reconstruction.$

$C3 Reconstruction  (Anti-pied-piping)

$ To obtain these representations, some elements that have been moved by a syn-
tactic rule (e.g. the preposition _naar_ in (73)a.) must, so to speak, be put

_Reconstruction_. The relevant changes that must be made can be formulated
rather easily if we decompose movement into copying (in the syntax) and 
deletion (at PF), and if we postulate a rule of operator conversion at LF.$
$ This can be formulated as in (75), where rule a. is crucially ordered before
rule b.:

turn it into the representation:$

$ Notice that the LF-representation (76)b. violates the Bijection Principle.
For this analysis to be correct, it must be assumed then ,that the Bijection 
Principle applies at LF. This is the independent evidence promised above for 
the assumption that the Bijection Principle applies at LF.$
$nl 1
$C3 Focussing
$nl 1
$ There is a rule, called the _Rule of Focus_, that replaces the focussed 
constituent by a variable and creates an additional equation to supply this
variable with a reference. Thus e.g. _He has seen JOHN_, where JOHN is focus
(has sentential stress), is replaced by something like
[ for x = John [he has seen x]]. By adopting this rule it is predicted that 
focussed constituents behave like quantified constituents (for these there 
also is also an operator -variable representation). This is so. In particular,
weak crossover phenomena hold for focussed constituents. If we have a sentence
like _his mother loves John_, then _his_ and _John_ can be coreferential only
if the major sentential stress does not fall on _John_, but on some other
element (in particular, on the verb). Similarly, this rule accounts for the 
difference in acceptability between e.g '_z'n_ moeder bemint _Piet_' (focus =
_Piet_, under normal intonation) and e.g '_zijn_ overwinning in de proloog
sterkte _Hinault_ in de overtuiging dat hij de Tour zou gaan winnen' (Focus is
not _Hinault_, under normal intonation). Under assumption of the rule of Focus
all these facts follow: the ungrammatical cases violate the Bijection 
Principle.$
$ Similarly, in a sentence like _Jan zag Jan_, the most natural interpretation 
under normal intonation is that the two occurrences of the word _Jan_
designate two different persons. If we focus the first NP, however,(_JAN_ zag
_Jan_) then a coreferential reading is possible(similarly, if we focus the
second NP). This can be accounted for by assuming the Focus rule. This will
yield a representation of the form [For x = Jan [ x zag Jan ]] for the latter
sentence. Under this representation a coreferential reading is possible because
it is more generally the case that if some name must be free from a variable,
then it does not exclude this name as a possible value for the variable, cf. a
sentence such as 'Every Democrat voted for Carter', which would have a
representation such as [Every x, x a democrat [ x voted for Carter]], and which
does not imply that Carter did not vote for himself.$

$C1 Preliminary General Conclusion
$nl 1
$ W.r.t. traces three different cases must be distinguished:$
$nl 1
$ 1) Cases of traces that are unavoidable (Strong, Weak Crossover)$ 
$ 2) Cases where traces can be simulated by hanging features on a restricted
set of lexical items in the direct neighbourhood of a trace (Wanna-contraction,
Aux-reduction)$ 
$ 3) cases where traces perhaps supply a more principled explanation for a set
of facts, but where a description in terms of more superficial generalizations
probably suffices for the purposes of Rosetta (raising verbs and anaphors,
that-trace phenomena, prenominal participles)$ 
$nl 1
$ Furthermore, certain cases are rather theory-dependent (e.g. the
c-command-condition on antecedent-trace relation). The cases of 1) would make
it necessary to have traces, but it seems that there are no problems without
traces for translation purposes. The cases of 2) are most ideally dealt
with by traces, but it can be done without them as well (although not really
elegantly). In the cases 3) we can make use of the more superficial
generalizations.$
$nl 1
$ W.r.t base generated gaps it seems that we must have a PROVAR until a rather
late point in the (generative) derivation, and a _pro_ in Spanish. Whether we
need it in the surface tree as well depends on how the grammar will be 
organized. In any case, it must be possible to find a PROVAR without there 
being an antecedent. It does not matter, where the PROVAR is created (speaking
analytically), in the surface parser or early (speaking analytically) in the
M-grammar. tIt is not to be expected that the 'parsing' of a PROVAR (or of pro)
yields any real difficulties.$

$A1 Auxiliary reduction
$nl 1
$ Suppose we want to deal with the reduction facts without using traces.
Then we might either complicate the reduction rule, or complicate all
rules that remove elements. Let us consider the first approach.$
$nl 1
$ Let us assume that every category has the attribute _deletionpossible_
(DELPOS) with the possible values {false, true}. We complicate all rules
that remove an element by adding the generative condition (by means of an
AND operator) DELPOS = true. The value of the attribute delpos is _true_ by 
default, but it can be set to _false_ by the rules _Auxreduction_, i.e. a
set of M-rules that set the value of the attribute _reduced_ (with possible
values {false, true}) to _true_. These rules must apply rather early in a 
generative system, at least before rules such as the shift-rules, reduction
rules in comparatives and some others. We assume that every verb that has a 
reduced form has the attribute-value pair canbereduced = true, and that all
other verbs have the pair canbereduced = false$ 
$ We might formulate the relevant rules in the following way:$ 
$nl 1

$ If we add the condition (delpos = true)mentioned to e.g. the Shiftrules, then

$ In the surface parser we mark all elements as delpos = true, except the
elements that are directly adjacent (and to the right of) a reduced auxiliary,

$ Weak crossover does not hold in the case of topicalization (_John_, _his_
mother saw) and in the case of relativization (the boy _who_ _his_ mother
loves). One explanation for this fact is as follows: in both cases there is a
wh-element. At LF, a coindexing of this wh-element with _his_ is excluded. But
what is not excluded is that _his_ bears the same index as the antecedent of
the wh-phrase : (_John_,_the boy_, resp.) (cf (i)). Of course, we must exclude
the case that the antecedent and the wh-phrase are coindexed at LF in order to
allow for this possibility. But there is independent evidence for this
requirement, because if these elements were coindexed, then one would predict
that there would be no ECP-violations if the subject is topicalized or
relativized (under the assumption that an operator that cannot assign a range
to a variable(such as an empty operator without an antecedent) cannot save a
gap by the second clause of ECP). The coindexing of antecedent NP and
wh-operator applies after LF, at LF', as Chomsky calls it.$

$ In this story things have been presented slightly simplified. Actually, in
all structures (41)-(43) _want_ and _to_ are separated by an empty node ( a
PROVAR), in particular also in (42). There are, however, principled reasons to
assume that this empty category is not present or not visible at the moment
Wanna- contraction applies.$

$ There are other ways to account for the unwellformedness of this structure.
These, however, also make crucial reference to traces. One alternative might be
to assume that the gap in indirect object position that must be related to 
the clitic _si_, cannot be so, because the trace in object position prevents
this gap from being locally A'-bound. In effect, this account is, for the 
purposes of this note, equivalent in the relevant respects.$
