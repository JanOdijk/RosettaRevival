\section{Introduction}
After several years of development of the Rosetta system, I was interested in 
the answer to the question how good Rosetta grammars are.
But, in general, evaluation of NLP systems is a difficult matter. However, I experimented with the (to Rosetta dictionaries adapted)
English evaluation test suite constructed by people from Hewlett-Packard Laboratories (Flickinger et al., 1987).\\
The advantages of this test suite above one to be constructed by the Rosetta team are:
\begin{itemize}
  \item it was constructed by English native speakers
  \item it was developed to test NLP systems
  \item the goal of the test was to test
grammatical types of sentences/discourse
  \item the test suite contains next to well-formed sentences anomalous sentences
   \item the test has been constructed independently from our grammars
\end{itemize}
It should be noted that it also has some disadavantages for evaluating Rosetta grammars:
\begin{itemize}
  \item it is not a test suite for {\bf translation} systems (but still useful for testing linguistic coverage)
   \item it contains some discourse phenomena (but this is a small number)
\end{itemize}

This document contains the results of an experiment with that test suite carried out in December 1990 and January 1991. This means t
hat the grammar could have been improved in the mean time.\\
In section2 I will explain the method that was used briefly. Section 3 contains the  results for the test suite as a whole. In secti
on 4, the  results per linguistic phenomenon tested are given. In section 5 , I tried to formulate some conclusions. The te
sentences used for this experiment are added in the appendix.

\newpage
\section{Method}

\begin{itemize}
\item The HP-test suite contains 1106 sentences (well-formed and anomalous together) that are divided into 20 sections representing 
linguistic phenomena\footnote{The order of the phenomena presented here is the order that was taken in our test suite and d
\begin{enumerate}
\item lexical dependencies
\item verb phrase complements
\item control
\item relative clauses
\item questions
\item comparatives and related constructions
\item anaphora
\item noun phrases
\item extraposition constructions
\item imperatives
\item tense and aspect
\item adverbial modification
\item object-gap complements
\item clefts
\item quantifier scope
\item conditionals
\item negation
\item predicative adjuncts
\item parentheticals
\item declarative dislocations
\end{enumerate}
The number of the sentences per phenomenon varies, as to test one phenomenon you will need more test sentences than for another. Wit
hin these sections subsections are indicated. For each subsection is indicated whether it belongs to the core or periphery 
\item As the original test suite contained a lot of words that are not in the Rosetta dictionaries and the goal of the test was not 
to test the dictionaries, I replaced the original words by words with the same syntactic properties and functions that exis
\item I typed  the sentences with the replaced lexical items in the test bank format of the Rosetta system. This concerned well-form
ed and anomalous sentences. The anomalous sentences were marked with an asterisk. The core/periphery distinction and the in
The sentences are in 17 files - mostly, one per phenomenon - that can be run separately.
\item The files were run with {\em batchros}. I selected {\em English-English},
{\em frozen }lexicons ,and {\em archive} versions for the analysis and generation modules.
\item The output files were compared with the input files.
\item The results were put into tables per phenomenon. Anomalous sentences were considered to be incorrect if the corresponding well
-formed cases were also incorrect.\footnote{Maybe it would have been better to introduce for them the category {\em undecid
\item A fault analysis of the incorrect cases was made.
\item The input files were presented to members of the Rosetta team (one per phenomenon) and they were asked to indicate for which c
ases rules (M-rules and S-ruules) had been written, in which cases the sentences should have been analysed correctly. These
\item The test results and the expected results were compared.

\section{Conclusions}

From the general results we can learn that only 26\% of the total number of sentences has been analysed and generated correctly in c
ase of well-formed sentences and not analysed in case of corresponding anomalous sentences.
In case of {\em core} sentences this is 30\% and for {\em periphery} sentences 8\%.\\
The results could be biased because anomalous cases are considered incorrect in case the corresponding well-formed ones were incorre
ct, but the goal was to test the coverage of linguistic phenomena, which includes the fact that some anomalous sentences sh
In general, we can say that the score is not very high.\\

{\bf Incorrect cases}\\
Looking at the analysis of the incorrect cases, we see that the largest part of the faults (12\%) has been caused by {\em adverbial 
modification}. Other important fault causing areas that influence the total score are: {\em lexical dependencies, control, 
This fact is influenced by the large number of cases for {\em lexical dependencies, control, questions, anaphora} and {\em noun phra
ses}, but not for {\em relative clauses}.\\
Important faults responsible for a lot of faults in the tests for other phenomena are: {\em coordination} and {\em ellipsis} (10\%),
 {\em wh} and {\em relatives} (14\%), and
{\em it}- and {\em there}-type sentences(4\%).  These could be topics to pay attention to.\\
A lot of incorrect cases are due to the fact that the English surface grammar is still `under-developed' and/or the English analytic
 M-grammar has not been tested yet. {\em Coordination and ellipsis} are phenomena that have been dealt with only
recently in the Rosetta project, so results cannot been expected yet.\\
However, the part that should be considered undecidable, because it contains still unknown or incorrectly filled lexical items is al
so considerable: 8.5\%.\\

{\bf Correct cases}\\
Phenomena that score rather well (above 30\%) are:
{\em verb phrase complements} (72\%),
{\em negation} (60\%),
{\em lexical dependencies}(49\%),
{\em tense and aspect} (44\%), and
{\em questions} (36\%).
However, {\em lexical dependencies} and {\em questions} are also fault causing areas for the total fault number, due to the large nu
mber of sentences (128 and 113 respectively).\\
Phenomena that score rather low (below 10\%) are:
{\em anaphora} (9\%),
{\em comparatives and related constructions} (7\%),
{\em relative clauses} (5\%),
{\em conditionals} (4.5\%),
{\em imperatives} (4\%),
{\em adverbial modification} (0\%),
{\em object-gap complements} (0\%),
{\em clefts} (0\%),
{\em predicative adjuncts } (0\%),
{\em parentheticals} (0\%), and
{\em declarative dislocations} (0\%).
In this set, {\em anaphora, comparatives and related constructions, relative clauses, adverbial modification, object-gap complements
 } and {\em clefts} contain a lot of core sentences. So these would be phenomena to work on!\\

{\bf Expected cases}\\
The expected total result correct was only 47\% of the total number of sentences (quantifier scope and discourse excluded!). This me
ans that the English Rosetta grammar covers at this moment only 47\% of the test cases. That is not very satisfying. Import

{\bf Expected results vs. test results}\\
Comparing the  total test results and the total expected results, we see that we expected the results to be better than it is based 
on the rules that have been written: the difference is 21\% of the total number of sentences. Some phenomena have been over
Looking at the fault analyses of these phenomena, we can conclude that the rules for {\bf wh-type} sentences should be given priorit
y.\\

I do not know how other English NLP systems score with this test suite, but I think that there is still a lot of work to do for us a
t this moment!
