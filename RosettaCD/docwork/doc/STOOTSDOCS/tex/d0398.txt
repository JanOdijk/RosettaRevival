\section{Introduction}
This document discusses the treatment of {\em se} in Spanish, the related 
translation problems, the 
consequences in the Dutch and English grammars caused by the tuning of the 
grammars and the remaining problems. As the monolingual
opinions and intuitions  and translational considerations
with respect to this 
matter differ, the solutions chosen are compromises and have not been carried 
out fully. Other solutions are possible as well.\\
 In the first section, the 
different uses of the word {\em se} in Spanish are summed up. The following 
section  deals with the translations of {\em se}. Then, the treatment of the
constructions with {\em se} in the Spanish grammar of Rosetta3 are discussed 
in section 4. The improvements for the treatment of impersonal {\em se}
that will be carried out are indicated.
Section 5 indicates the consequences for the Dutch and 
English grammar with respect to the approach to impersonal {\em se}
and section 6 discusses the remaining problems. Section 7 
contains possible solutions for the problem of translating impersonal
{\em se}-constructions (or `reflexive passive'), impersonal passive and the 
indefinite pronoun {\em men} in Dutch. A short overview of the behaviour
of other western european languages with respect to this topic is given.
Section 8 discusses the possible translation of {\em se}-constructions for 
middle voice, that is not dealt with in Rosetta3.

\section{The different uses of Spanish {\em SE}}
We can distinguish three different uses of the Spanish word {\em se}
(cf. Slager (1987)):
\begin{enumerate}
  \item {\bf Reflexive pronoun}\\
{\em Se} is the reflexive pronoun of the third person singular and plural. It 
can be compared with Dutch {\em zich}, {\em zichzelf} and English 
{\em himself}, {\em herself}, {\em themselves}.\\
It occurs in the conjugation of {\em inherent} reflexive verbs such as e.g.
{\em afeitarse}: {\em me afeito, te afeitas, se afeita,} etc. (Dutch: {\em ik 
scheer me, jij scheert je, hij scheert zich,} etc.).\\
It can also occur as an argument that is coreferential with the subject 
argument as in {\em se ve a s\'{\i} mismo} ({\em hij ziet zichzelf}) in which 
case it can be followed by {\em a s\'{\i} mismo}. \\
The same holds for reciprocal constructions as {\em se ve\'{\i}an a s\'{\i} 
mismos} ({\em zij zagen elkaar}).

  \item {\bf Clitic personal pronoun}:\\
If two clitic personal pronouns of the third person follow each other, then the 
first clitic pronoun (the indirect object {\em le} or {\em les}) 
has to be changed into {\em se}.\\

\begin{lxam}
&&&Se lo he contado (ik heb het hem/u/haar verteld)
\end{lxam}
\begin{lxam}
&&&Puedo llev\'{a}rselo (ik kan het voor hem/u/haar meenemen)
\end{lxam}

\item {\bf Impersonal pronoun}:\\
In constructions with impersonal {\em se} is indicated that the action is 
performed by one or more unspecified persons.\\
There are two possibilities:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item {\bf with} (number) agreement verb-`semantic object':\\

\begin{lxam}
&&&Se destruy{\em en} much{\em as} especi{\em es} en la selva.\\
&&&(Er worden veel soorten in het oerwoud uitgeroeid/\\
&&&Men roeit veel soorten uit in het oerwoud.)\\
\end{lxam}

This construction is used if a) the `semantic object' is a thing or b) the 
`semantic object' is human, but not a clitic pronoun and indefinite or 
unspecified such that it would not get {\em a} as object in a not-impersonal 
construction. The `semantic object' becomes `grammatical subject'.\\
An object of the first or second person is excluded from this construction, 
because it requires a third person subject.\\

\begin{lxam}
&&*&Aqu\'{\i} se respetamos\\
&&&Hier worden wij gerespecteerd
\end{lxam}
We refer to this construction as {\em sepassive} in Rosetta.

  \item {\bf without} (number) agreement verb-`semantic object':\\

\begin{lxam}
&&&Se asusta a los ni\~{n}os\\
&&&(Men maakt de kinderen bang\\
&&&De kinderen worden bang gemaakt.)
\end{lxam}

This construction is used for cases in which the `semantic object' would get 
{\em a} in a not-impersonal construction. The verb form is third person 
singular and the `semantic object' remains `grammatical object'.\\
This construction can also be used with intransitive and ergative verbs or 
copula verbs:\\

\begin{lxam}
&&&Se baila.\\
&&&Er wordt gedanst/men danst.
\end{lxam}

\begin{lxam}
&&&Se llega a las tres.\\
&&&Men komt om drie uur aan.
\end{lxam}

\begin{lxam}
&&&Se es joven or no se es\\
&&&Men is jong of men is het niet.
\end{lxam}

A construction with a first or second person object is possible here:\\
\begin{lxam}
&&&Aqu\'{\i} se nos/os respeta\\
&&&Hier worden wij/jullie gerespecteerd
\end{lxam}

We refer to this construction as {\em seactive} in Rosetta.
\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}


{\em Se} is a {\em clitic} pronoun in all uses. Characteristics 
of clitic pronouns are:
\begin{itemize}
  \item place: before finite verb, after infinitive, imperative  and gerundio:\\

\begin{lxam}
&&&{\em Se lo} ha dado\\
&&&Quiero d\'{a}r{\em selo}\\
&&&Est\'{a} d\'{a}ndo{\em selo}\\
&&&Quisiera hab\'{e}r{\em selo} dado\\
&&&D\'{a}{\em selo}
\end{lxam}
  \item order: it is involved in the clitic pronoun order: {\em se}, 2, 1, 3.\\

\begin{lxam}
&&&{\em Se lo} ha dado\\
&&&{\em Se me lo} daba\\
&&&{\em Se te me} recomenda
\end{lxam}

  \item `clitic cluster': it is involved in the `clitic cluster' rules for the 
order of clitics and  negation element in declarative and interrogative 
sentences.\\

\begin{lxam}
&&&Carmen se lo quiere dar.\\
&&&Carmen no se lo quiere dar.\\
&&&?Se lo quiere dar Carmen?\\
&&&?No se lo quiere dar Carmen?
\end{lxam}

\item clitic climbing: in case of verbraising the clitics of the embedded verb 
can climb up.\\

\begin{lxam}
&&&Carmen quiere d\'{a}rselo\\
&&&Carmen se lo quiere dar
\end{lxam}
\end{itemize}

The occurence of two adjacent
 {\em se}'s is excluded. In sentences with reflexive verbs a construction 
with {\em uno} can be used.\\

\begin{lxam}
&&*&Se se averg\"{u}enza\\
&&&Uno se averg\"{u}enza\\
&&&Men schaamt zich
\end{lxam}

For the same reason an impersonal {\em se}-construction is impossible in case 
of a {\em se} that replaces {\em le(s)} before {\em lo(s), la(s)}:\\

\begin{lxam}
&&*&Se se lo dice\\
&&&Uno se lo dice\\
&&&Se lo dicen\\
&&&Men zegt het hem/haar/u
\end{lxam}

In general, it is not possible to refer to impersonal {\em se} with a pronoun:\\

\begin{lxam}
&&*&Si {\em se} quiere que {\em le} sirvan bien,..\\
&&&Als men goed bediend wil worden
\end{lxam}

\begin{lxam}
&&*&{\em Se} intenta enga\~{n}ar{\em se}\\
&&&Men probeert zichzelf te bedriegen
\end{lxam}

\begin{lxam}
&&*&{\em Se} teme perder{\em se}\\
&&&Men is bang te verdwalen
\end{lxam}

In these cases {\em uno} or the third person plural can be used.\\
It is possible to refer to impersonal {\em se} by repeating it as in the 
following example:\\

\begin{lxam}
&&&Se mata porque se quiere sobrevivir\\
&&&Men doodt omdat men wil overleven
\end{lxam}

In most cases {\em se} obeys the rules of clitic climbing,\\ 

\begin{lxam}
&&&Debe respetarse a los ni\~{n}os\\
&&&Se debe respetar a los ni\~{n}os\\
&&&Men moet (de) kinderen respecteren
\end{lxam}

except for the use as 
impersonal {\em se} {\bf without} agreement (the {\em seactive} in Rosetta) in 
case of a verb without a direct object or prepositional object. 
In those cases {\em se} 
should be next to the most left verb. (cf. Slager (1987), p. 189)\\

\begin{lxam}
&&&Aqu\'{\i} no se puede fumar\\
&&*&Aqu\'{\i} no puede fumarse\\
&&&Hier mag men/je niet roken
\end{lxam}

In an interpretation of impersonal {\em se} {\bf with} agreement ({\em 
sepassive} in Rosetta) these sentences are both correct:\\

\begin{lxam}
&&&Aqu\'{\i} no se puede fumar\\
&&&Aqu\'{\i} no puede fumarse\\
&&&Hier mag men hem (bijv. die tabak van jou) niet roken 
\end{lxam}

\section{The translation of {\em SE}}
\subsection{Reflexive pronoun}
There are three cases:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item inherent reflexive verb:\\
In these cases {\em se} is only translated if the verb in the other language 
also is reflexive.
  \item reflexive argument:\\
In these cases it is always translated:\\

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
\hline
Spanish & Dutch & English\\
\hline
se      & zichzelf & himself\\
        &          & herself\\
        &          & themselves\\
        &          & oneself\\
\hline
\end{tabular}
   \item reciprocal argument:\\
In these case it always co-occurs with {\em a s\'{\i} mismo/as} and is 
translated as follows:\\

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
\hline
Spanish & Dutch & English\\
\hline
se      & elkaar   & eachother\\
\hline
\end{tabular}

\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Clitic personal pronoun }
The replacement of {\em le(s)} with {\em se} is a language-specific phenomenon.
The translation of this {\em se} is the translation of {\em le(s)}:\\

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
\hline
Spanish & Dutch & English\\
\hline
se      & hem   & him \\
        & haar  & her\\
        & het   & \\
        & hun (hen?)   & them\\
\hline
\end{tabular}
 \\

In some cases it has no literal translation because it is the `redundant clitic 
pronoun' for 
indirect objects in Spanish:\\

\begin{lxam}
&&& Se lo dieron a Juan\\
&&& Ze gaven het aan Juan
\end{lxam}

\subsection{Impersonal pronoun}
As already can be concluded from the examples of the previous section, this 
{\em se} has various translations.\\

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
\hline
Spanish & Dutch & English\\
\hline
construction with: & construction with: & construction with:\\
se      & men    & one\\
        & passive voice & passive voice\\
        & ze (generic)     & they (generic)\\
        & je (generic)    & you (generic)\\
        &        & people\\  
\hline
\end{tabular}
   \\

 The last three translations are more informal or solutions for cases that do 
not fit in the `normal' rules. They also have Spanish equivalents:\\

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
\hline
Spanish & Dutch & English\\
\hline
uno      & je   & you\\
         & (men)  & (one)\\
3 plural & ze   & they\\
         &      & (people)\\
la gente & de mensen & people\\
         & (men)  &  \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
     \\

It will be clear that we have a real translation problem here:
\begin{itemize}
  \item English and Dutch do not have something like the 
impersonal {\em se}-constructions
  \item Spanish and English do not have a good
translation equivalent for {\em men}\footnote{Note that French and German have 
equivalents for {\em men}, i.e.\ {\em on} and {\em man} respectively. Italian 
has just like Spanish a `reflexive passive' construction with {\em si}, but the 
use of {\em si}-indefinito shows more characteristics of a {\em men}-like noun 
than the Spanish `{\em se}-indefinido' in {\em seactive} constructions.}
\end{itemize}

Note that the translation {\em one} for {\em men} is rather formal and, in general,
only a good translation in combination with negation and/or modals 
(cf.\ Margreet Sanders).\\

\begin{lxam}
&&&One does not smoke here\\
&&&Men rookt hier niet/er wordt hier niet gerookt
\end{lxam}

\begin{lxam}
&&&One should not do that\\
&&&Dat behoort men niet te doen/dat behoor je niet te doen
\end{lxam}

\begin{lxam}
&&&One cannot do that here\\
&&&Dat kun je hier niet doen
\end{lxam}
A related problem to these phenomena is the difference in preference for the 
passive voice in the three languages: in English and Dutch it is ofen used; 
in Spanish it is rather unusual: the active voice is preferred or the 
seactive/sepassive-construction should be used.

\begin{itemize}
\item Spanish active ({\em uno} or 3rd person plural):\\

\begin{lxam}
&S&&Le {\em pegaron} a \'{e}l\\
&D&&{\em Ze sloegen} hem/Hij {\em werd geslagen}\\
&E&&{\em They hit} him/He {\em was hit}
\end{lxam}
\begin{lxam}
&S&&{\em Uno} se averg\"{u}enza\\
&D&&{\em Men} schaamt zich/je schaamt je\\
&E&&{\em One} is ashamed of oneself/{\em people} are ashamed of themselves
\end{lxam}

\item Spanish seactive:\\

\begin{lxam}
&S&&{\em Se asusta} a los ni\~nos\\
&D&&{\em Men maakt} de kinderen {\em bang}/De kinderen {\em worden bang gemaakt}\\
&E&&The children {\em are frightened}
\end{lxam}
\begin{lxam}
&S&&{\em Se} nos {\em respeta} aqu\'{\i}\\
&D&&{\em Men respecteert} ons hier/wij {\em worden} hier {\em gerespecteerd}\\
&E&&We {\em are respected} here/{\em they respect} us here
\end{lxam}
\begin{lxam}
&S&&{\em Se bailaba}\\
&D&&{\em Men danste}/er {\em werd gedanst}\\
&E&&{\em They danced}/{\em people danced}
\end{lxam}
\begin{lxam}
&S&&Aqu\'{\i} no {\em se puede comer}\\
&D&&Hier {\em mag men/je} niet {\em eten}/hier {\em mag} niet {\em gegeten worden}\\
&E&&{\em It/one is (you are)} not {\em allowed to eat} here/\\
&&&{\em one/you can}not {\em eat} here
\end{lxam}

\item Spanish sepassive:\\

\begin{lxam}
&S&&{\em Se venden} naranjas aqu\'{\i}\\
&D&&{\em Ze verkopen} hier sinaasappelen/\\
&&&Er {\em worden} hier sinaasappelen {\em verkocht}\\
&E&&{\em They sell} oranges here\\
&&&{\em Oranges are sold} here
\end{lxam}
\begin{lxam}
&S&&Aqu\'{\i} no {\em puede comerse}\\
&D&&Hier {\em mag men hem/haar/dat/dit} niet {\em eten}/\\
&&&{\em hij/zij/dat/dit mag} hier niet {\em gegeten worden}\\
&E&&{\em It/one is} not {\em allowed to eat him/her/this/that} here/\\
&&&{\em He/she/this/that can}not {\em be eaten} here
\end{lxam}

\section{The treatment of constructions with {\em SE} in Rosetta3}
\subsection{Reflexive pronoun {\em se}}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item The reflexive pronouns for inherently reflexive verbs are spelled out 
by the {\em reflspelling}-rules (TC\_reflspelling) in the 
XPPROPtoCLAUSE-subgrammar. On basis of properties of the subject argument the 
correct form is spelled out. In case of a 
third person singular or plural (\'{e}l, 
ella, ellos, ellas, ello, usted, ustedes) {\em se} is spelled out.
  \item Reflexive arguments are spelled out by the 
{\em argreflspelling}-rules\\
(TC\_FC\_argreflspelling) in the XPPROPtoCLAUSE-subgrammar. On basis of identity 
of the subject and another argument the correct form is spelled out.
  \item The reciprocal arguments are substituted in 
{\em Rreciprocalsubstitution1}. In the appropriate cases the reflexive pronoun 
is spelled out. 
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Clitic personal pronoun {\em se}}
A CLITIC-node in which the clitic pronouns are collected
is always created after the verb 
({\em Tcliticnodeinsertion}) in the VERBPPROPsubgrammar\footnote{Because clitics operate as a 
cluster in the sentence we decided to put a node above it.
If it remains 
empty, it is deleted in TC\_FC\_VPandCLdeletion. }.
In case of an indirect object a clitic pronoun is inserted by
{\em Tindobjcliticspelling} in the VERBPPROPformation-subgrammar to account for 
the  obligatory redundant clitic pronoun of indirect objects,
whether it is a personal pronoun or not\footnote{For some people this clitic 
pronoun is not obligatory. In an analytic version of the Spanish grammar, this 
rule should be optional}. A third 
person indirect object receives the regular {\em le(s)}-clitic form.
The personal pronouns are substituted  in the CLAUSEtoSENTENCE-subgrammar
by several substitution rules with their
regular forms: strong forms after a preposition and in subject position, weak 
forms in other cases.
After the substitution rules 
 the cliticrules account for the clitic 
pronouns of the {\em direct} object that is a {\em personal pronoun}. 
There are two cases:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item {\em plus}: the case in which a direct object clitic is added\\
\begin{lxam}
&&&La veo a ella
\end{lxam}

  \item {\em minus}: the case in which a direct object clitic is added and the 
direct object itself is deleted.\\
\begin{lxam}
&&&La veo 
\end{lxam}
\end{enumerate}

The
{\em IOclCambioSEplus/minus}-transformations and filters change the {\em le(s)}
clitics of an {\em indirect} object 
into {\em se} if they would be followed by a third person clitic pronoun of the 
direct object. There is only one place for a third person clitic in the 
clitic cluster. There are {\em plus} and {\em minus} variants for the {\em 
direct} object.\\

\begin{lxam}
&&&Se la  entreg\'{o} a ella a Juan\\
&&&Se la entreg\'{o} a Juan\\
&&&Quiero entreg\'{a}rsela a ella a Juan\\
&&&Quiero entreg\'{a}rsela a Juan\\
&&&Entr\'{e}gasela a ella a Juan\\
&&&Entr\'{e}gasela a Juan
\end{lxam}

The clitic cluster is put before the verb in finite clauses and glued to the 
verb in infinitive, gerundio and imperative clauses (TC\_FC\_Gluerules).\\
If the indirect object is a {\em personal pronoun}, it is deleted optionally in 
Tpron-IOdel.\\

\begin{lxam}
&&&Se la entreg\'{o} a ella a \'{e}l\\
&&&Se la entreg\'{o} a ella
\end{lxam}


\subsection{Impersonal pronoun {\em se}}

The constructions with impersonal {\em se} are mainly accounted for in the 
following rule or transformation classes:
\begin{itemize}
  \item RC\_voicerules
  \item RC\_Emptysubstitution
  \item TC\_ObjectOk
  \item TC\_SeSpelling
\end{itemize}
The voice rules and EMPTYsubstitution rules 
are involved because impersonal {\em se}-constructions often 
have to be translated into or are the translations from
passive voice constructions with an EMPTY-element, 
although the {\em se}-constructions have {\em active} verb forms.\\

\begin{lxam}
&&& (EMPTY) se bailaba.\\
&&&Er werd gedanst (door EMPTY)
\end{lxam}

\begin{lxam}
&&&(EMPTY) se venden naranjas.\\
&&&Er worden sinaasappelen verkocht (door EMPTY)
\end{lxam}

The objectOk transformations are involved because after this transformation 
class all S-trees should contain a subject, which seems to be absent in
some {\em se}-constructions.\\
The seSpelling transformations spell out the clitic
pronoun {\em se} in the appropriate cases.

\begin{itemize}
  \item {\bf voice rules}:\\
We distinguish 4 voices in Spanish:
\begin{itemize}
  \item active
  \item passive
  \item seactive
  \item sepassive
\end{itemize}
They correspond to the IL-expressions for voice in the following way:
\begin{itemize}
  \item IL-active $\leftrightarrow$ active, seactive
  \item IL-passive $\leftrightarrow$ sepassive, seactive, active, passive
\end{itemize}
Seactive and active have a lower bonus as translations of IL-passive. That is 
not correct for seactive, because 
sepassive and seactive are in complementary distribution with respect to the 
specificity and definiteness of the objects.
Sepassive 
should be added as a translation to IL-active with a lower bonus for the same 
reason.
\begin{itemize}
\item
{\em Active} voice is the same kind of voice as it is in Dutch and English.
It requires a non-EMPTY subject.
\item
The same holds for {\em passive} voice, but it is rather unusual to use it in 
Spanish, so it should receive a lower bonus in future versions of Rosetta. The 
passive voice rule puts the subject argument in a por-phrase, just as in 
Dutch (door-phrase) and English (by-phrase), and assigns modus past participle 
to the verb. In RC\_Clauseformation the auxiliary verb of the passive voice
{\em ser} is introduced (RClauseformation2). A non-EMPTY object (that will 
become subject later) must be present (i.e. intransitive verbs are excluded).
Ergative verbs cannot be passivized in general. An EMPTY subject is also 
excluded in contrast to Dutch.
\item
{\em Seactive} voice is the name for impersonal se-constructions {\bf without} 
agreement of the object (if present); the verb form is always 3rd person 
singular. It requires an EMPTY 
subject argument, because it should be possible 
to translate it into Dutch impersonal passives
{\em er wordt ge-V door EMPTY} and {\em x wordt ge-V 
door EMPTY}.  In case of ergative verbs an EMPTY object that will become 
subject later is also accepted. Note that Dutch seems to prefer the 
other translation equivalent of this se-construction, a construction with {\em 
men}, in ergative cases: {\em men gaat om 3 uur naar huis} vs. {\em er wordt om 
3 uur naar huis gegaan}. {\em Seactive} voice has all the characteristics of 
active voice except for that it has an EMPTY subject (or object in ergative 
cases).
\item
{\em Sepassive} voice is the name for impersonal se-constructions {\bf with}
agreement of the non-EMPTY object that must be present (i.e.\ intransitive 
verbs are excluded). It requires an EMPTY subject that is put into a por-phrase.
The object becomes subject later. In this respect it resembles the passive 
voice, but it differs with respect to the requirement of an EMPTY subject and 
the fact that the verb form remains {\em active}, a characteristic that also 
can be noticed with {\em middle voice} as in e.g.\ {\em These books sell well}.
\end{itemize}
There are restrictions on the definiteness or specificity of the objects for 
the choice of {\em seactive} or {\em sepassive}.

  \item {\bf EMPTY substitution rules}:\\
The EMPTY in subject position is a special EMPTY that is substituted in
EMPTYsubstitution. We distinguish 4 kinds of EMPTYs:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item {\em emptyempty}, for non-subject empty arguments
  \item {\em seempty}, for subject empty argument or object empty argument of 
ergative verbs, that coresponds to Dutch 
{\em menempty} and English {\em oneempty}.
  \item {\em ellosempty}, for subject empty argument, that corresponds to Dutch 
{\em zeempty} and English {\em theyempty}.
  \item {\em unoempty}, for subject empty argument, that corresponds to Dutch 
{\em jeempty} and English {\em youempty} (which does not exist yet).
\end{enumerate}

In case of {\em seactive} voice {\em seempty}
is spelled out as an NP with the auxiliary 
category EC (comparable to the treatment of Dutch {\em er} with such an 
auxiliary category EC) if the verb is not reflexive. If the verb is reflexive, 
it is spelled out as {\em uno}. There is also a rule with lower bonus that 
spells it out as {\em uno} with non-reflexive verbs for cases where a clitic 
pronoun {\em se} will occur later. It was not necessary to introduce the
EC-NP here, the introduction
also could have been postponed to the ObjectOk transformations
that follow this 
rule class immediately. After all, it would have been more `natural' to do that 
as it fits nice into the task of that transformation class.\\
In the {\em sepassive} case the {\em por EMPTY}-phrase is deleted.  

\item {\bf ObjectOk transformations}:\\
In general, the objectOk rules introduce subject elements in case the subject 
position is not filled. The subject-verb-adjective agreement and 
subject-to-subject transformations can be 
formulated straightforwardly then. 
In case of sepassive voice an auxiliary category PRONP with EC is introduced in 
subject position with person, number and gender copied from the object.
The `semantic object' of the passive voice
is moved to subject position or remains 
in object position as is also possible in ergative 
constructions, but then a `copy-variable' of the object is put into subject 
position (PRONPVAR).\\
Originally, PRONPVAR, PRONP-EC and NP-EC were thought to be the same auxiliary 
element
(`little pro' in LGB): 
copies of the `semantic object' and in case of seactive `default with 
3rd person singular masculine', 
comparable to {\em emptyello} (`{\em het}') in {\em 
llueve} ({\em het regent}),
but at a certain moment we thought it would be more convenient to have three 
different elements:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item PRONPVAR as the subject copy for ergative and passive `objects'.
  \item NP-EC, analogous to Dutch, to be spelled out as {\em se} (as in Dutch
{\em er}) for seactive voice.
  \item PRONP-EC as the subject copy of the `object', to be spelled out as 
{\em se} for sepassive voice and excluded from subject-to-subject-raising.
\end{enumerate}

It will be clear that other solutions 
than a special category are also possible, e.g.\ a condition on 
voice in the sespelling rules and
the subject-to-subject-raising rule. This latter rule now is formulated for 
NPs (including NP-EC) and PRONPVAR and not for PRONP.\\

\begin{lxam}
&&& Se puede comerlo (Het kan gegeten worden)\\
&&& PRONPVAR puede haber sido robado este libro (dit boek kan gestolen zijn)\\
&&& Este libro puede haber sido robado\\
&&*& Se pueden vender naranjas (er kunnen sinaasappelen verkocht worden) 
\end{lxam}

At the moment we doubt the ungrammaticality of the last example. It is not 
possible to use seactive, because the object would not receive {\em a} in a not 
impersonal sentence, so it is now impossible to translate a sentence like 
{\em er kunnen sinaasappelen verkocht worden} (but see below).


  \item {\bf SeSpelling transformations}:\\
NP-EC and PRONP-EC are spelled out as the clitic pronoun {\em se} and deleted 
by the SeSpelling rules. These rules only work for finite sentences.
Rules for infinite sentences should be added do be able to derive:\\

\begin{lxam}
&&& Debe respetarse a los ni\~{n}os
\end{lxam}

The problem is that in those cases an empty subject element has to be left to 
be able to do subject-to-subject-raising. This cannot be PRONP-EC because that
was excluded from subject-to-subject-raising and it cannot be NP-EC, because it 
would be spelled out as {\em se} again in the higher clause. A condition on 
voice should be added to the se-spelling rules and an extra deletion rule for 
NP-EC has to be formulated (but see below).
\end{itemize}
In Spanish empty subject elements such as {\em emptyello} and PRONPVAR can be 
deleted after the agreement transformations, because it is a pro-drop-language.
In languages like Dutch such elements have to be spelled out as {\em het} or 
{\em er}. The deletion is done in TC\_FC\_deletion. This transformation/filter 
class also contains rules to delete (optionally) subject personal 
pronouns and object personal pronouns of sepassive\footnote{In this version of 
Rosetta3 the deletion of such personal 
pronouns is always carried out} and indirect object personal 
pronouns\footnote{The optional deletion direct object personal pronouns is 
taken care of in TC\_FC\_Cliticrules (plus and minus variants). An alternative 
would have been to do the `clitic doubling' in the clitic rules and delete the 
direct object personal pronoun optionally in the deletion rules, but that was not 
convenient with respect to the {\em a}-insertion for those personal pronouns.}.\\

\begin{lxam}
&&& {\em emptyello} llueve $\leftrightarrow$ llueve\\
&&& {\em emptyello} me gusta nadar $\leftrightarrow$ me gusta nadar\\
&&& {\em emptyellos} dicen que viene $\leftrightarrow$ dicen que viene\\
&&& PRONPVAR llega Juan $\leftrightarrow$ llega Juan\\
&&& PRONPVAR es construida la casa $\leftrightarrow$ es construida la casa\\
&&& ella nada $\leftrightarrow$ nada\\
&&& \'{e}l nada $\leftrightarrow$ nada\\
&&& PRONPVAR llega ella $\leftrightarrow$ llega\\
&&& se los venden ellos $\leftrightarrow$ se los venden\\
&&& me lo ha dado a m\'{\i} $\leftrightarrow$ me lo ha dado
\end{lxam}

The approach described above is considered to be wrong in the following aspects:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Spelling out an element in subject position is not the task of 
EMPTYsubstitution, but of objectok transformations
  \item subject-to-subject-raising 
with sepassive constructions is not accounted for
  \item Problem with subject-to-subject-raising in seactive cases
  \item Three different abstract empty elements in subject position 
with more or less the same function gives the 
impression of an unecessary complicated grammar
\end{itemize}
Therefore the grammar will be changed in the following way:
\begin{itemize}
  \item In RC\_Emptysubstitution the rule that substitutes {\em seempty} in 
case of seactive voice  will not introduce NP-EC, but just delete the EMPTYVAR.
The same holds for the rule that spells out {\em uno} in that case
  \item In TC\_ObjectOk a PRONPVAR will be introduced in subject position in 
case of sepassive and seactive voice (but without reflexive verb). 
In case of sepassive it will have the 
properties of the object which must be 3rd person if it is a personal pronoun 
and in case of seactive the PRONPVAR will be 3rd person singular.
In case of seactive also the NP {\em uno} will be introduced (for reflexive 
verbs and for cases {\em se} is not allowed later).
  \item TC\_SeSpelling will spell out a {\em se} clitic in the CLITIC-node 
under condition of sepassive or seactive voice and the existence of a PRONPVAR 
in subject position in finite and infinite sentences.
  \item The PRONPVAR is deleted in finite clauses.
\end{itemize}
   Subject-to-subject-raising accounts for PRONPVAR and NP
and does not have to be changed.
   The {\em se} clitic can climb in the verbraising rule as a normal 
clitic. The rule need not to be changed.\\
The result will be that 
\begin{enumerate}
  \item 
we can account for all raising structures with {\em se}
  \item
get rid of NP-EC and PRONP-EC.
  \item introduce (empty) subject elements in objectok rules and delete 
EMPTYVARs in Emptysubstitution
\end{enumerate}
It should be noted that we also derive now {\em debe fumarse aqu\'{\i}} with a 
seactive voice that is  said to be ungrammatical by some people. Maybe we can 
formulate an obligatory clitic climbing rule for these cases in the future.

\section{Consequences of the approach to impersonal {\em SE}}
The approach to the treatment of {\em se}-constructions in the Spanish
grammar of Rosetta3 as sketched above had some consequences in the grammars of 
Dutch and English as they had to be attuned.\\

The consequences in the Dutch and English grammar are:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Dutch:\\
A subject EMPTY must be spelled out as {\em men} in case of {\em active} voice.
This is felt as problematic as {\em men} seems to refer to something.\\
In case of {\em passive} voice, there is no problem in Dutch as it allowes for 
an EMPTY subject that moved to a {\em door}-phrase can be deleted. In subject 
position {\em er} will be inserted if no `semantic object' is present or in 
case of a `postsubject'.\\

\begin{lxam}
&&& Men danste\\
&&& Er werd gedanst\\
&&& De sinaasappelen werden verkocht\\
&&& Er werden sinaasappelen verkocht
\end{lxam}

A consequence is now, that the sentences {\em men danste} and {\em er werd 
gedanst} have the same relationship as {\em Jan verkocht het huis} and {\em 
het huis werd door Jan verkocht}.\\
See for discussion of the approach to Dutch voice doc.\ R0315.
  \item English:\\
In the active case the subject EMPTY is spelled out as {\em one} or {\em they}
(of course distinguished from the numeral {\em one} and the normal personal 
pronoun {\em they}).\\
In the passive case it is moved to a {\em by}-phrase and deleted. The 
`semantic object' 
becomes subject in the objectOk rules. 
If no such argument is present, passive is not possible.\\

\begin{lxam}
&&&One danced/they danced\\
&&*&It was danced\\
&&&The oranges were sold\\
&&&Oranges were sold/they sold oranges
\end{lxam}

The same consequence as in Dutch holds for English: the sentences {\em they sold 
oranges} (in a `generic' sense)
and {\em oranges were sold} have the same relationship as {\em John bought 
the house} and {\em the house was bought by John}. 
\end{itemize}

Because {\em ze} (generic) and {\em je} (generic) seem to have comparable 
properties to {\em men}, it was decided to treat them (and their translations 
{\em they, emptyellos} and {\em you, uno} respectively) also as underlying
EMPTYs.
The different keys were neccessary as they have different properties with 
respect to person and number.

\section{Problems with the approach to impersonal {\em SE}}
There are some problems with the approach sketched above:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Verbpatterns:\\
The attribute {\em synvps} indicates the possible syntactic arguments in the VP 
a verb requires. In general, these are the direct object, indirect object, 
prepositional object and directional objects with their syntactic category. the 
verbpattern transformations spell out these patterns in the S-tree structure, 
i.e.\ the category and the order. If a verb allows for an EMPTY argument in the 
VP this must be indicated in its verbpatterns. Ergative verbs do not have a 
subject argument, but a direct object argument that can become subject during 
the derivation (TC\_ObjectOk). If an ergative verb allows for a (surface) 
subject argument spelled out as {\em se} or {\em men}, as is the case, then the 
verbpatterns of that verb should contain a pattern with a direct object EMPTY.
This consequence was noticed rather late. Most of the Spanish rules had already
been written. It is necessary to add a verbpattern to the ergative verbs in the 
dictionary. This has not been done yet. An alternative solution would be to 
account for this phenomenon in the verbpattern rules by allowing that if the 
verbpattern of the ergative verb allows for a NP as direct object, it also 
allows for an EMPTY.\\
 From a Dutch point of view this is not an urgent matter as 
there seems to be a preference to use {\em men},
which has NP-characteristics, in these 
cases instead of the impersonal passive, which favours the actual verbpattern 
situation.\\

\begin{lxam}
&&&Men gaat hier om drie uur naar huis\\
&&?& Er wordt hier om drie uur naar huis gegaan
\end{lxam}

From a Spanish point of view ergative verbs do not behave differently from 
non-ergative verbs with respect to se-constructions, so adding the 
EMPTY-verbpattern seems to be a natural consequence.\\
At the moment clauses with {\em men} and an ergative verb cannot be analysed/
generated in Dutch.

  \item Distinction between {\em emptyempty} and {\em seempty}:\\
The distinction between {\em emptyempty} for a non-subject empty argument and 
{\em seempty} for a subject empty argument was made, because this {\em seempty} 
had to be spelled out as {\em men} in Dutch and could not be seen as having the 
same semantics as a `normal' empty argument. This distinction turned out to 
cause problems if {\em seempty} ({\em menempty, oneempty}) is to be translated 
into {\em emptyempty} ({\em zeroempty}). Consider, for example, the following 
sentences with their translations with Dutch {\em aanactive}
(cf.\ doc.\ R326, section 4.15):\\

\begin{lxam}
&&&Hij liet (aan {\em zeroempty}) het boek lezen\\
&&*&He let ({\em zeroempty}) read the book\\
&&&He let {\em oneempty} read the book\\
&&&He let the book be read (by {\em oneempty})
\end{lxam}

\begin{lxam}
&&& He let {\em oneempty} hear the solo\\
&&& He let the solo be heard  (by {\em oneempty})\\
&&*& Hij liet aan {\em menempty} de solo horen\\
&&& Hij liet (aan {\em zeroempty}) de solo horen
\end{lxam}

The solution for this problem would be to merge the {\em seempty} and the
{\em emptyempty} into one {\em empty}, but this will not solve the 
following problems.
 
\item 2-place ergatives vs. non-ergatives:\\
There are more problems with different argument patterns. Consider for example
the following Dutch example:\\

\begin{lxam}
&&&Men houdt hier van kaas
\end{lxam}

The non-ergative verb {\em houden van} has to be translated here into
the ergative verb {\em gustar} in Spanish. 
{\em Gustar} has the same subcategorization frame as 
the Dutch verb {\em bevallen}.\\

\begin{lxam}
&&&Deze thee bevalt me\\
&&&Este t\'{e} me gusta/me gusta este t\'{e}
\end{lxam}

A se-construction is only possible if the {\em subject} is EMPTY or in ergative 
cases the {\em object} is EMPTY. The correspondent of {\em men} in {\em men 
houdt hier van kaas} should be the {\em indirect object} of {\em gustar}. This 
means that a se-construction is not possible and we have to use something like
{\em la gente}, which cannot be seen as a regular translation of {\em men} in 
all cases.\\

\begin{lxam}
&&&Men houdt hier van kaas\\
&&&Aqu\'{\i} les gusta el queso a la gente
\end{lxam}

In Spanish a special EMPTY substitution rule has been added to account for this 
situation, but the verbpattern of {\em gustar} has not been adapted yet as it
seems to 
require a non-EMPTY NP as indirect object. Note that Dutch {\em bevallen} has 
the same properties in this respect:\\

\begin{lxam}
&&*&Die thee bevalt men
\end{lxam}

A problem is that there are also two-place ergative verbs that do allow for an 
EMPTY indirect object argument:\\

\begin{lxam}
&&&Zij wordt mooi gevonden (door {\em menempty})\\
&&&Parece hermosa (a {\em seempty} or {\em emptyempty}?)
\end{lxam}

If we merge {\em seempty} and {\em emptyempty} it will not be possible to 
translate sentences like {\em men houdt hier van kaas} into a Spanish sentence 
with {\em gustar}, because it is not possible to make a distinction in the 
verbpattern and
the following sentence is considered to be wrong:\\

\begin{lxam}
&&*&Gusta el queso
\end{lxam}

\end{itemize}

\section{Possible solutions for a problem with the translation of impersonal
{\em SE}}
It will be clear from the previous sections that the approach to the translation 
of {\em se} implemented is a Spanish-oriented one. The most problems we met 
involve ergative verbs and especially the translation of non-ergative into 
ergative verbs which is allowed in Rosetta as we did not consider ergativity a 
translation relevant property. If we
did, we could not translate {\em houden van} 
into {\em gustar} and {\em vinden} into {\em parecer}, for example.\\
Writing this document I considered three possible solutions for this problem:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item {\bf Separate treatment of {\em men} and `impersonal passive'}:\\
{\em Men} is not treated as an EMPTY, but as a NOUN and translated into Spanish 
as the idiom {\em la gente}, {\em emptyellos} (`{\em ze}' in Dutch) or {\em uno
} (`{\em je}' in Dutch). The {\em seactive} and {\em sepassive} voice in 
Spanish are translations of Dutch passive, i.e.\ the `impersonal passive'.
The consequence will be that\\

\begin{lxam}
&&&men danste
\end{lxam}
will be translated into\\

\begin{lxam}
&&&la gente bailaba\\
&&&bailaban\\
&&&uno bailaba
\end{lxam}
and not into\\

\begin{lxam}
&&&se bailaba
\end{lxam}
which is still the best translation. {\em Se bailaba} would only be the 
translation of {\em er werd gedanst}. Just as (\ref{1}) only will correspond to
(\ref{2}) and not to (\ref{3}) that will be translated into (\ref{4})-(\ref{6})
of which (\ref{4}) is a poor translation and (\ref{5}) and (\ref{6}) only 
can be used in an informal generic sense.\\

\begin{lxam}
\label{1}
&&&se debe respetar a los ni\~{n}os
\end{lxam}
\begin{lxam}
\label{2}
&&&(de) kinderen moeten gerespecteerd worden
\end{lxam}
\begin{lxam}
\label{3}
&&&men moet (de) kinderen respecteren
\end{lxam}
\begin{lxam}
\label{4}
&&&la gente debe respetar a los ni\~{n}os
\end{lxam}
\begin{lxam}
\label{5}
&&&deben respetar a los ni\~{n}os
\end{lxam}
\begin{lxam}
\label{6}
&&&uno debe respetar a los ni\~{n}os
\end{lxam}

If impersonal passive for one-place ergative verbs in Dutch will not be 
allowed, a se-construction with a corresponding verb in Spanish 
(ergative or not!) never will be 
derived if we translate from Dutch to Spanish and translating from Spanish to 
Dutch we would have a serious problem as the most plausible translation with
{\em men} would be not possible then. This means that we either allow impersonal 
passive for one-place ergative verbs in Dutch  or need an EMPTY-{\em men} rule 
for these cases. Both ioptions mply the verbpattern problem, see section 6.\\

\begin{lxam}
&&&Se ven\'{\i}a a las ocho\\
&&?&Er werd om 8 uur gekomen\\
&&&Men kwam om 8 uur
\end{lxam}

It seems to me that this solution is to rigorous; the translations into Spanish 
get worse and translations from Spanish into Dutch may become impossible.\\
It is not a solution for English as English does not have an impersonal passive 
and always needs a rule to spell out EMPTY as {\em one} or {\em they} for 
ergative and non-ergative verbs.

  \item {\bf Both a NOUN-men and an EMPTY-men}:\\
We could combine the actual implementation with the solution above. The 
consequence would be that Dutch {\em men} is analysed in two ways: as a NOUN, 
corresponding to {\em la gente, emptyellos, uno} in Spanish and {\em one, they} 
in English, and as an EMPTY, corresponding to {\em se} in Spanish and {\em one, 
they} in English. In a translation proces from Dutch to Spanish, the 
{\em se}-translation would be in the set of possible translations and 
translating from Spanish to Dutch the {\em se}-constructions would have a 
translation with {\em men}, but the {\em houden van/gustar}-problem will not be 
solved as it will not be possible to evaluate
one of the derivation trees Dutch analysis will yield. Translation between 
Dutch and English always will yield two equal translations for 
{\em men}-{\em one, they}.\\

I think this solution should be rejected.

  \item {\bf SE-passive, SE-`men' and robust EMPTY-men}:\\
Just as in the first solution we treat {\em men} mainly as a NOUN in Dutch. We 
keep the seactive/sepassive-construction for `impersonal passives' in Spanish, 
but as a translation for the NOUN {\em men} an abstract element NP-EC is 
introduced (i.e.\ in the normal substitution rules, not in EMPTY substitution) 
that is spelled out as {\em se} and if that is not possible as {\em la gente}, 
{\em uno} or {\em emptyellos} depending on the case:
\begin{itemize}
  \item {\em se} if subject of a non-ergative verb
or object of an ergative verb, but not in the case the verb is
reflexive or a clitic personal pronoun {\em se} is present 
  \item {\em la gente} if indirect object
  \item {\em uno} or {\em emptyellos} if subject of a nonergative verb
or object of an ergative verb in case they are reflexive verbs or a clitic 
personal pronoun {\em se} is already present
\end{itemize}
A disadvantage of this solution is that in Spanish rules have to be duplicated
(compare section 4) at a different stage of the grammar.\\
To avoid the problems we had with NP-EC and subject-to-subject-raising we would 
have to restrict this use of {\em se}-`men' to finite sentences. 
Subject-to-subject-raising will apply obligatorily. For verbs without a direct 
object or prepositional object present this seems to be correct, but with that 
object present it is only one of the possibilities: 
(\ref{7}) will be derived, but (\ref{8}) will not be derived.\\

\begin{lxam}
\label{7}
&&&Se debe respetar a los ni\~{n}os
\end{lxam}

\begin{lxam}
\label{8}
&&&Debe respetarse a los ni\~{n}os
\end{lxam}

Translating from Spanish to English a {\em se}-construction that can be 
interpreted as {\em se}-passive or {\em se}-`men' will yield two identical 
translations with {\em one} or {\em they}. A sentence with {\em one} or {\em 
they} in English has to be analysed in two ways, one as a NOUN corresponding
to {\em men}, the other as EMPTY for `impersonal passive'.\\
In the Dutch grammar, 
it will still be necessary to have a rule that spells out an EMPTY as 
{\em men} for cases an impersonal passive is not possible and in the other 
language it is. These are the cases in which a passivizable verb is translated 
into a non-passivizable one, or a non-ergative (passivizable) verb into an 
ergative one, which is considered to be not-passivizable in Dutch for example.
This rule would only have to work in generation with lower bonus
as it can be seen as a kind of robustness measure.\\
We could do the same for English: the rule that spells out an EMPTY as 
{\em one} or {\em they} will only work in generation with lower bonus.\\
Finally, we also could do the same in Spanish for the rules that introduce 
NP-EC and spell it out as {\em se} etc.\\

I think this solution will be the best one at this moment.\\
Probably, it will not be necessary anymore to treat {\em zegeneric} and 
{\em jegeneric} as EMPTY then.
\end{enumerate}
By adding the rules necessary to account for phenomena that are not `natural' 
in that language to the generation components with lower bonus only, we achieve 
that the analysis components are relieved. They also can form a class of rules 
that 
only will be added if necessary in the translation process for a specific 
language pair. If two languages belong to the same class with respect to 
impersonal passive, `men' and `reflexive passive', passivizability and 
ergativity, the `robustness rules' are not necessary. 
But it will be hard to find such a language pair among the most important 
western european languages. We can classify them with respect to impersonal and 
reflexive passive and `men' as in the following table:\\

\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|c|}
\hline
language & impersonal & reflexive & `men'\\
         & passive    & passive   &      \\
\hline
Dutch    &    +       &    -      &  men\\
English  &    -       &    -      &   -\\
Spanish  &    -       &    +      &   -\\
German   &    +       &    -      &  man\\
French   &    +/-     &    -      &  on\\
Italian  &    -       &    +      &  -\\
\hline
\end{tabular}
  \\

The impersonal passive in French is restricted in the sense that the sentence
must contain a (prepositional) object or adverbial (cf. Jan Odijk).\\

\begin{lxam}
&&*&Il a et\'{e} tir\'{e} (Er is geschoten)\\
&&&Il a et\'{e} tir\'{e} sur Jean (Er is op Jan geschoten)
\end{lxam}  

Italian has the same kind of `reflexive passive' as Spanish (se-constructions), 
but the {\em seactive} form of it ({\em si} indefinito)
is less restricted than in Spanish and although 
the verb form is singular, other elements that  have to agree with the subject  
have plural number (cf. Brinker (1978)). Consider for example (\ref{9}) and 
(\ref{10}):\\

with reflexive verb:\\

\begin{lxam}
\label{9}
&&&Ci si lava (men wast zich)
\end{lxam}

with plural agreement of past participle:\\

\begin{lxam}
\label{10}
&&&Ci si \`{e} lavati (men heeft zich gewassen)
\end{lxam}

From the scheme above can be concluded that an `impersonal passive' co-occurs 
with a `men'-like noun, and a `reflexive passive' excludes `impersonal passive' 
and a `men'-like noun.\\
Note that the languages of Rosetta3 (Dutch, English and Spanish) show 
all possibilities. This means that by adding a western european language we 
can copy one of the approaches in  the actual grammars of Rosetta3.

\section{ {\em SE}-construction as translation of middle voice}
Middle voice is not treated in Rosetta3, because it is a difficult problem in 
cases the verbs that are translation equivalents do not allow both for middle 
voice, cf. doc.\ R0315:\\

\begin{lxam}
&&&Bureaucrats bribe easily\\
&&*&Bureaucraten kopen makkelijk om
\end{lxam}
It should be noted that in these cases Spanish (which was not mentioned in 
R0315) can always use a sepassive or 
seactive construction in case the subject is left out  and the original object 
becomes subject:\\

\begin{lxam}
&&&Los bur\'{o}cratas se sobornan f\'{a}cilmente (sepassive)\\
&&&Se soborna f\'{a}cilmente a bur\'{o}cratas (seactive)
\end{lxam}

\begin{lxam}
&&&These books sell well\\
&&&Deze boeken verkopen goed\\
&&&Estos libros se venden bien (sepassive)
\end{lxam}
This means that at the moment one of the possible translations of 
se-constructions is missing.

Next to that, middle verbs exist in Spanish too, such as e.g.\ {\em cortar}
(Dutch: {\em snijden})\\

\begin{lxam}
&&&este cuchillo no corta\\
&&&dit mes snijdt niet
\end{lxam}
