\section{Introduction}

This document describes how scope is dealt with in Rosetta3.

Two ideas play a central role in the treatment of scope in Rosetta3:

\begin{description}
  \item[1] The first central idea, derived from Montague grammar, is to encode 
scope relations by the order in which 
scope bearing elements are substituted: the earlier some phrase is
substituted, the narower its scope.
\item[2] The second central idea is the assumption that left-right order
of phrases corresponds directly with scope: the more to the left a phrase 
occurs (in a sentence) the wider its scope is.
\end{description}

The latter central idea is incorrect in the sense that there are cases where 
some phrase C1 appears to the right   of some other phrase C2 though it has
narrow scope relative to C2, but it is nevertheless useful for the following 
reasons:

\begin{description}
  \item[] Counterexamples always involve cases
where syntactic and semantic condition do not determine uniquely some scope
interpretation. The scope interpretation is either free (the sentence is 
ambiguous), or is determined by extra-linguistic factors.
  \item[] Counterexamples (almost) never 
require different translations for the two (or more) different scope 
interpretations
\end{description}

These two central ideas have been implemented in the following manner:
\begin{description}
  \item[1] There are substitution rules that encode scope interpretations.
These substitution rules apply relatively late in the derivation, at a point
where the definitive left-right order is known, and does not change anymore.
  \item[2] These substitution rules are subject to a substitution order 
condition that guarantees that substitution applies from right to left:
first the rightmost phrase is substituted, then the one preceding this
phrase etc. In practice this substitution order exists in two varieties:
in analysis there is  a very strict condition, requiring substitution
from right to left. In generation a slightly weaker condition holds, because
the condition can be ignored if some phrase is not a scope bearing phrase.
\end{description}

The generative substitution order condition has been implemented in an 
interesting way only in Dutch generation. In English and Spanish these
conditions simply yield true in all cases.
 

\section{The need for variables and Substitution markers}
The substitution order conditions must implement the concept of
'substitution from right to left'. Since a syntactic structure can contain
all sorts of elements that do not partake in substitution, it is {\bf not} 
possible 
to implement this concept by stating the following condition:

\begin{description}
  \item[] substitution can take place only if there are no (NP,PREPP, ADVP)
phrases to the left of it  
\end{description}

The idea here would be 
that if some phrase C1 occurs to the left of the phrase to be 
substituted, then this phrase C1 has been substituted too early.

It is not possible to implement  the concept in this way because phrase
C1 might have got there in some other way than by substitution, e.g. it
might have been introduced syncategorematically (e.g.
{\em  it } in {\em  it is raining hard}), or it might be part of an idiom
(e.g. {\em  the cat} in {\em  the cat has got Mary's tongue}).

In order to avoid this problem it would be necessary to make a distinction 
between elements that are in the structure and got there by substitution 
and elements that are in the structure that did not get there by substitution.
There is no way to make this distinction in Rosetta, especially since the
elements that are parts of idioms and elements that are introduced 
syncategorematically can in general also be introduced into structures 
by substitution (when used as arguments).

The relevant effect can be achieved in some other way, however. Elements
that are substituted are always substituted for some variable. Elements that
are introduced syncategorematically or that are part of an idiom are not 
substituted, hence there is no variable for them at any point in the derivation.
It is now possible to implement `right-to-left substitution' by adopting the
following condition:

\begin{description}
  \item substitution is possible only if no variable occurs to the right of
the variable that is substituted for.
\end{description}

The idea here is that if some variable V1 occurs to the right of the variable that
is substituted for, then this  variable V1 should have been substituted for
earlier.

This is the condition that we adopted for Rosetta3. It accounts neatly for
the fact that there can be idiom chunks and elements that are introduced 
syncategorematically. The following table illustrates which paths this 
condition allows in analysis for three phrases P1, P2, P3, in this order
(X1, X2, X3 indicate the variables that remain in the structure after 
application of a substitution rule):

\begin{tabular}[t]{|c|c|}
\hline
Substituted Phrase & Result \\
\hline
\hline
--         &  P1 P2 P3\\
P3         &  P1 P2 X3\\
P3-P1      &  blocked \\
P3-P2      &  blocked \\
P2         &  P1 X2 P3\\
P2-P3      &  P1 X2 X3\\
P2-P3-P1   &  blocked\\
P2-P1      &  blocked\\
P1         &  X1 P2 P3\\
P1-P3      &  X1 P2 X3\\
P1-P3-P2   &  blocked\\
P1-P2      &  X1 X2 P3\\
P1-P2-P3   &  X1 X2 X3\\
\hline
\end{tabular}

As one can see, all phrases can be idiom chunks or syncategorematic phrases
and only one substitution order is allowed.

This method, however, has one problem: Scope bearing elements that are
introduced into the structure without there being a variable for them
cannot be accounted for adequately. This problem arises w.r.t negation
and certain adverbs. Negative elements were originally simply introduced
into the structure. Doing this would allow for the following substitutions
in analysis for a structure containing the phrase P1 and the negative 
element N, in this order:

\begin{tabular}[t]{|c|c|}
\hline
Substituted/introduced Phrase & Result \\
\hline
\hline
N & P1 \\
N-P1 & X1\\
P1 & X1 N\\
P1-N & X1\\
\hline
\end{tabular}

As one can see, the structure containing only the variable X1 can be obtained
in two different ways: either one first substitutes N and then P1, or
one first substitutes P1 and then N. The problem here is that after
the negative element N has been removed, it is not 'remembered' anymore
that some scope relevant phrase has been removed already from a position to
the right of P1.

As a consequence, it is necessary to have elements that 
mark that in a specific position a scope bearing element has
been removed.

This has been done for NEG and POS. There are rules that introduce special
markers that indicate in generation where NEG or POS is going to be 
introduced in the structure and that indicate in analysis on which positions
NEG and POS were present before they were removed.
The relevant markers are called NEGVAR and POSVAR, but they are NOT variables.
(they are not member of LSDOMAINT\_VARCATSET, which is a necessary requirement 
for variables, and they do not have an index attribute)\footnote{They are 
member
of the set LSAUXDOMAIN\_VARCATSET, but this has no significance other than that
they are counted as relevant in the substitution order condition.} 
They are introduced by the rules Rnegvar1, Rnegvar2, Rnegvar3, Rposvar.

This technique has not (yet) been used for VP-modifying adverbs that cannot be
substituted. As a consequence, for these adverbs scope is not accounted for 
adequately (yet).

Since the technique must be used in several cases, one might also generalize
the technique to all cases: Assume the existence of exactly one
substitution marker {\em S}. Assume a rule that applies 
before substitution rules and 
that introduces {\em S} into the structure, at right edge.
Reformulate substitution and introduction rules in the following manner:
Substitution and or introduction of some phrase is possible if the
substitution marker {\em S} follows  the point of substitution or introduction;
shift {\em  S} to a position immediately preceding the point of substitution.
Finally there should be a rule that applies after the substitution rules 
and that removes {\em  S}. 


\section{SubstorderCondition}

The substordercondition has been implemented by means of three functions
(Substordercondition1, Substordercondition2, Substordercondition) in
lsmruquo.
These functions differ in the number of list variables that must be taken into
account. Each of the functions simply checks whether there are elements
from LSAUXDOMAIN\_VARCATSET\footnote{Notice that the reference must be made to
{\bf LSAUXDOMAIN}\_VARCATSET, and crucially {\em not} to 
{\em  {\bf LSDOMAINT}\_VARCATSET}. The first set contains variables and
 substitution markers, the second set only variables. The naming is, due to
historical reasons, very unfortunate. It would be better to change the name
of {\em  {\bf LSAUXDOMAIN\_VARCATSET}} into 
{\em  LSAUXDOMAINT\_SUBSTMARKERS} to avoid confusion.} in the list variables. 
If there are, the functions
yield {\em  false}, otherwise they yield {\em  true}.

The functions should be used in the following manner:
specify all list variables occurring to the 
right of the variable to be substituted as parameters of the appropriate 
function and call it as a matchcondition on the (analytical) input model.

\section{Gsubstordercondition}

The generative substitution order conditions always yield  {\em  true} 
in the English and Spanish grammars. These grammars should be extended by more 
interesting versions of these functions.

In Dutch a more interesting version of these conditions exists. Again
three different functions exist, differing in the number of list variables
taken into account. They are called {\em  gsubstordercondition1, 
gsubstordercondition2, gsubstordercondition}.
The functions are functions from a number (1,2 or 3)
of listvariables and a tree variable to a BOOLEAN.

These functions are defined as follows:
\begin{description}
  \item[if] the substitution order condition used in analysis holds, then
        the function yields {\em true},
  \item[ otherwise] if the relevant tree to be substituted is not a 
scope bearing phrase, then the function yields {\em  true} 
 \item[otherwise] if the lists to the right of the place of substitution
do not contain variables for scope bearing phrases, then the function yields
{\em  true}
  \item[otherwise] the function yields {\em  false}.
\end{description}

Whether the tree to be substituted is a scope bearing phrase is determined
by the function {\em  quantificational}. Whether there are variables for
scope bearing phrases 
in a list is determined by the function {\em  Qvarinmu}

The function {\em  qvarinmu} checks whether there are variables or
substitution markers in a list
for which the function {\em  quantificational} yields {\em true}. If so,
the function {\em  qvarinmu} yields {\em  true}, otherwise it yields 
{\em  false}.\footnote{There is an error in the function qvarinmu as it is
currently implemented. The test whether the relevant tree is a substitution
marker or variable is lacking in the first IF-statement.}


The function {\em  quantificational} is a function from a tree to a boolean.
It yields {\em  true} in the following cases:

\begin{itemize}
  \item[] If the category of the topnode is NP or NPVAR with the attribute 
{\bf definite} set to {\em  indef} OR the attribute {\bf syntquant} set 
unequal to {\em  omegaquant}
  \item[] If the category of the topnode is NEG or NEGVAR
  \item[] If the category of the topnode is ADVP or ADVPVAR which is
a sentential adverb ({\em  sentadv}) or a temporal adverb which is
not a reference or duration adverb.
  \item[] If the category of the topnode is PREPP or VARPREPP and
the function {\em  qvarinmu} applied to the list dominated by these nodes 
yields {\em true}.
\end{itemize}


In all other cases the function yields false. Notice that the functions
{\em  quantificational} and {\em  qvarinmu} call each other, creating a
recursion.

The treatment w.r.t. adverbs is somewhat ad hoc, due to the fact that there
is no attribute on ADVPs that indicates whether it is relevant to scope
or not.
The treatment does not take the presence of scope bearing elements inside
an ADJP into account.
In is possible, in principle, to make the approach more robust by allowing
certain configurations that are not allowed now, but lowering the
correctness bonus.

It might perhaps be useful to make the generative substitution order condition 
sensitive to a distinction between A-positions and A'-positions. This 
distinction derives directly from modern generative grammar. In this theory
the following hypothesis is a very natural one:

\begin{description}
  \item[] For quantified phrases in A'-positions left right order\footnote{
Actually, not the concept of left-right order would be relevant, but the notion
of {\em c-command}. For the languages under discussion, however, this 
corresponds directly to left-right order in most cases.} indicates
directly the scope relations (the more to the left, the wider the scope) 
  \item[] For quantified phrases in A-positions there is not necessarily
a connection between
scope relations and left-right order
\end{description}

If this hypothesis is true, we might allow substitution of quantified phrases
in generation in A-positions even if they violate the current generative 
substitution order conditions. One area where this might give positive results
concerns the interaction between negation and direct objects. In Dutch
a quantificational phrase to the left of a negated element has scope over
the negated element (cf. e.g. {\em  Hij zag \'{e}\'{e}n boek niet}. 
The position to the left of the negated element ({\em  preadvrel})is
an A'-position. In English the relevant phrase will often function as a direct
object({\em  objrel}), which (in English) is always an A-position. 
By incorporating the
hypothesis mentioned we might allow a translation of the Dutch sentence given
simply as {\em  he did not see one book}, which is correct (I think) in this
case. It should be investigated further whether this method might be useful.

\section{Point of substitution}

A general problem arose in connection w.r.t. the point of substitution.
The question is: at what point of embedding do substitution rules take place.
To make this question clearer the following example will be used: in a 
sentence such as {\em  hij woont in deze stad}, is the NP {\em  dit zwembad}
substituted in the PREPP subgrammars, or in the SENTENCE subgrammars?

On the one hand, one would like to apply  substitution at the sentential
level. After all, this is the level at which scope relations for the sentence
should be defined. Furthermore, the PREPP can be shifted by the shift 
transformations, and these apply usually only for PREPPs containing a variable.
(cf. {\em  In deze stad woont hij, In welke stad woont hij?}). Notice that
it is not possible to shift the variable for the whole PREPP, since 
substitution of such PREPPs applies much earlier (because a crucial reference
to and a change of material inside the PREPPPROP is necessary).
In certain cases elements can even be shifted out
of the PREPP (e.g. in the case of wh-questions, cf. 
{\em  waar woont hij naast?}, etc.

However, this cannot be the general strategy, because certain PREPPs can occur
embedded under NPs (or under several NPs (and PREPPs)), 
which would require that the 
substitution rules apply at indefinite depths (cf.
{\em  hij bekeek {\bf  het water in het zwembad}, hij bekeek {\bf het 
chloorgehalte van het water in het zwembad}}, etc.).

So it is also required to apply substitution of such NPs in the PREPP 
subgrammars.

If one would simply allow for both options, in many cases ambiguities w.r.t.
the point of substitution of such NPs will arise. So, one would like
to determine for each case individually, where substitution of NPs should
apply, to avoid such ambiguities.

Unfortunately, this is not always possible. In particular, for PREPPs used 
at a sentential level one cannot exclude PREPPs in which NPs have been 
substituted already (this would exclude all idioms containing such a PREPP),
and one cannot exclude PREPPs in which NPs have not been substituted yet
(this would exclude relativization and topicalization 
of the relevant NP-positions).

As a consequence, due to this fact in many cases ambiguities arise.


A similar problem arises w.r.t. the subject of CLOSEDXPPROPs and
closed SENTENCES, i.e.
at what point in the derivation are the boldface phrases substituted:
{\em  ik vind {\bf  hem} aardig, {\bf hij} lijkt mij aardig},
{\em  ik kreeg {\bf de pen} in de standaard, {\bf hij} bleek aardig te zijn,
{\bf  hij} schijnt te komen} etc.

In these cases allowing both options creates ambiguities again, which
can even be motivated semantically (e.g. if the subject is quantificational
and the verb is {\em  seem}). An additional problem is that certain languages
might not allow some of these constructions, e.g. one cannot say
{\em  he turned out to be ill} in Spanish using an infinitival complement.
Instead a finite sentence must be used, and the subject {\em  he} occurs
in the embedded clause. So there is a meaning associated to some of these
Dutch and English
structures  that cannot be expressed in Spanish, creating an isomorphy problem.
At the moment, rather ad-hoc conditions have been imposed upon 
substitution rules in Dutch and English to avoid substitution in the 
superordinate clause in such cases, though I actually think that Spanish
should allow for substitution rules substituting an NP into the subject
position of a subordinate clause.

\section{Emptys}

EMPTYs are substituted by special substitution rules, applying at  a different 
point in the grammar than where other substitution rules apply, 
so that an intermingling 
with other substitution rules is
not possible (EMPTYs always have narrower scope than normal NPs).



If two or more EMPTYs occur in  a structure and no special conditions are 
added, they can be substituted
in principle in two (or more) ways, corresponding to two (or more) 
different scope relations in
syntax.
Since it is assumed that EMPTYs have existential quantification as their
semantics,
these two (or more) distinct syntactic derivation trees yield two (or more)
distinct IL-trees  which are semantically equivalent 
($\exists_{x}\exists_{y} \phi$ is equivalent to $\exists_{y}\exists_{x} 
\phi$).

In order to avoid such unnecessary ambiguities conditions have been added in
analysis that guarantee that desubstitution of EMPTYs applies from left to
right. In generation no conditions on substitution exist. They are not
necessary, and in fact not desired, since they might block certain derivations
in generation, though there is no need to.


\section{Propositional Phrases}

Substitution of propositional phrases is performed in a separate rule class.
In the first versions of these rules no special conditions have been added
to guarantee that there are no superfluous ambiguities when there are two
or more propositional phrases. In a later stage some of such conditions have
been added, but not yet in a systematic way. This should be ameliorated.


\section{Alternatives}

Certain alternative ways of dealing with scope have circulated rather 
informally. I will list two of them. They both attempt to find a solution to
the major problem with the current method of dealing with scope, i.e.
the fact that the NP-internal structure can be seen and changed in too late
a stage in the derivation. There are certain processes that require
an inspection or a change of the syntactic structure inside NPs before these NPs are 
substituted.  For certain cases of inspection the relevant information can be
encoded into attributes and percolated upward to the NP node, but this is
not always possible, and often, when it is possible in theory, it does not 
yield a natural description. Changing the NP-internal structure before
substitution is not possible at all.
Some example rules that require changes inside NPs before they have been
substituted:  anaphoric rules (to account for the proper distribution and
interpretation of {\em  elkaar} and {\em zichzelf}), rules to deal with
inalienable possession constructions in Spanish (to interpret {\em  me} in
{\em  me ha lavado las manos} as the possessor of {\em  las manos} and to 
translate it into {\em  Hij heeft mijn handen gewassen}), certain cases
of shifting (cf. {\em  {\bf  Wat} heeft hij {\bf voor boeken} gekocht?}),
etc.

\subsection{Indexed NPs}

This alternative treatment, which I will call the 
{\em  indexed NP}\footnote{In this paper I will restrict attention to NPs, but 
the method should be extended to indexed ADVPs, PREPPs etc.} proposal,
assumes that there are substitution rules, but that they do not encode
scope relations. Scope relations are encoded by special scope rules.
Substitution rules apply very early in the derivation process, in an arbitrary
but unique order. Substitution rules substitute not simply NPs, but 
indexed NPs. An indexed NP is an NP with a special attribute {\bf index} of 
type {\em  integer}.
Before substitution the NP has this attribute set to zero. A substitution rule
substitutes this NP for some variable with index j, and assigns this index
to the index attribute of the NP substituted. From this (early) point 
in the derivation all sorts of
rules and transformations can apply, and they have access to NP internal 
material, which they can also change if required.
In a very late stage of the derivation scope rules apply. These are rules
taking one tree as an argument and one index parameter. They turn the 
NP with index  attribute equal to the index parameter of the rule into an
NP with its index attribute set to zero (in generation), provided that
the generative substorder condition (no indexed NPs to the right
of the relevant NP) holds.   

In analysis the scope rules make NPs with index = 0 into NPs with some index,
from right to left.
The substitution rules desubstitute indexed NPs in an arbitrary but fixed
order, turn them into NPs with index=0, and leave a variable with the index
of the desubstituted NP.

NP variables are now indexed NPs not dominating any material. They can be 
deleted if some indexed NP with the same index occurs in the structure,
so that control phenomena and  anaphora can be dealt with adequately. 

The method requires a special type of pre-action, which appears
to be slightly more complicated than the current one.
 
A problem for this method is, that it is not clear whether a compositional
semantics  can be found for it.

\subsection{Order encoding}

A second alternative, which has not been worked out yet in detail, but which
I do want to mention is the following. Assume that substitution rules perform
substitutions and encode scope relations. Assume furthermore that  they apply
very early in the derivation. The fact that they apply very early in the 
derivation should make it possible to avoid the problem w.r.t. NP-internal
material. Reference to the actual left right order is made in an indirect 
manner. Every substitution rule assigns some integer to the NP (in an 
attribute called {\em  order}) it has 
substituted. This integer  encodes the relative scope relations, i.e.
the first substitution rule applied assigns {\em  1}, the second one 
{\em  2}, etc.  Next, all other relevant transformations and rules apply.
Finally, there are {\em  order rules}. These order rules check whether
the relevant NPs are in the order as indicated by the {\em order} attributes.
For every NP in the structure it must be true that its order attribute has
a higher value than the order attribute of the NPs that follow.

This method requires further investigation. Some initial questions that arise:
what about control, anaphora? What are order rules exactly: are they
rules with an order parameter?, and if so, is scope now not encoded twice
in the structure?; if these order rules are rules, what is their semantics?
The order rules might (in generation) be implemented as a filter as well. 
In analysis, some procedure which is not official part
of the grammar should then assign the correct order attributes to NPs. Is that
possible?, etc.
