\section{Introduction}

This report covers the sixth half-year of the Rosetta project:
the period from August 1, 1987 until February 1, 1988.

As usual the report is brief and non-technical; we 
refer to the relevant project documents for further 
information.  
In section 2 an overview is given of the activities in the past
half-year. In section 3 we discuss some organisational aspects.
In section 4 the main Rosetta documents written in this period
are enumerated. 
In section 5 an overview is given of the person-hours spent on the
project.

\section{Activities in the period from August 1, 1987 until February 1, 1988}

\subsection{Introduction}


For a better understanding of the activities, the
global design of the Rosetta3 system and the tasks of its components
are recapitulated here.

\bigskip

Rosetta3 consists of an analysis component and a generation component.


The analysis component translates an input sentence or
phrase of the source language into an expression of the interlingua,
called a semantic derivation tree. It
indicates the semantic structure of the sentence.
The generation component translates an interlingua expression into a sentence 
or
phrase of the target language. 

\bigskip

Due to ambiguities the analysis component yields a {\bf set} of
semantic derivation trees for each input phrase and the
generation component yields a set of translations for each semantic derivation 
tree, but in this short overview we ignore this aspect and describe the system 
as though the two main components and each of their modules give exactly
one result.

\bigskip

The {\bf analysis component} consists of four modules, to be applied 
consecutively:

\bigskip

\begin{itemize}

\item  {\bf A-MORPH}. This module converts the words of the input phrase 
into `lexical S-trees', by means of a dictionary for stems and morphological
rules for inflection and derivation.
If we ignore complicating details, A-MORPH consists of three parts:

\begin{enumerate}

\item Segmentation phase. In this phase the word is divided into a stem and 
affixes by application of segmentation rules.

\item Dictionary phase. The dictionary gives the lexical information for the stem.

\item Lextree phase. By application of so-called lextree-rules the sequence of 
stem(with the lexical data)  and affixes is converted into a lexical S-tree.
In a lexical S-tree the derivational
structure of the word is made explicit and the inflection data are represented
in the form of features, e.g. {\it number = plural} instead of the affix {\it s}.

\end{enumerate}

So the output of A-MORPH is a sequence of lexical S-trees.


\item {\bf  S-PARSER}. By this module the sentence, i.e. the 
sequence of lexical 
structures, is parsed by means of surface rules.
The result is a surface tree (S-tree), a constituent structure 
of which the leaves are the
lexical S-trees of the input sequence, in the original order.

\item
{\bf M-PARSER}. This module analyses the surface tree by means of
so-called
M-rules, which have the task to unravel the underlying syntactic 
structure of the sentence, which corresponds to its semantic structure.
  The result is a syntactic derivation tree,
of which the leaves are basic expressions and the other nodes are labelled
by the names of the M-rules that have been applied. 


\item {\bf A-TRANSFER}. This module converts the syntactic derivation tree 
into a semantic derivation tree of the interlingua. The isomorphic grammar
approach of Rosetta requires that the grammars of different languages are tuned 
in such a way that they assign
similar syntactic derivation trees and identical semantic derivation trees
to sentences that are each other's translation. Thanks to this, the module
A-TRANSFER (and also G-TRANSFER) is relatively simple: 
the M-rules in the syntactic  derivation tree are replaced by semantic rules
and the basic expressions are replaced by basic meanings, by means of local
transfer rules.

\end{itemize}


The {\bf generation component} consists of four modules:

\begin{itemize}

\item {\bf G-TRANSFER}. By this module the semantic derivation tree is 
converted 
into a syntactic derivation tree. The meaning rules in the semantic derivation 
tree are replaced by syntactic M-rules of the target language 
and the basic meanings are replaced by
basic expressions of the target language.


\item {\bf M-GENERATOR}. The syntactic derivation tree is converted 
into a surface tree
of the target language by applying M-rules in the way indicated by
the derivation tree and the control expressions of the grammar.


\item {\bf LEAVES}. The surface tree is converted into a sequence of 
lexical S-trees
which are the leaves of the surface tree, i.e. the subtrees with specific
word categories at the top.


\item {\bf G-MORPH}. The lexical S-trees are converted into words (strings) by
applying morphological rules. The result is a phrase of the target language.

\end{itemize}

The analysis component and the generation component of a particular language
are based upon the same grammar. This is possible because 
the rules of the grammar can be used
in two ways: for analysis and for generation. So A-MORPH and G-MORPH 
make use of the same set of morphological rules, M-PARSER and M-GENERATOR use
the same syntactic rules and A-TRANSFER and G-TRANSFER use the same
transfer rules. The only exception to this is 
S-PARSER which is based on surface rules that have to be written for analysis
only. In generation the counterpart of S-PARSER is LEAVES,
which does not need to apply surface rules, because the
output of M-GENERATOR is always a correct surface tree.  

\bigskip

The activities in the project can be subdivided into three main  parts:

\begin{enumerate}

\item {\bf Formalism.} The formalism defines the function of the 
system in a mathematical way, abstracting away from the implementation
aspects. For each module it specifies the notation of the rules and their 
interpretation and the way in which the function of the module follows from the 
rules.

\item {\bf Software.} The software work includes: (i) the implementation of the
analysis and the generation component, in particular of the
algorithms of the eight modules, (ii) building rule
compilers which translate from rule notation into  programming language,
(iii) building various kinds of tools, including a software management system 
and a number of test tools.


\item {\bf Linguistics.} The linguistic work includes the actual writing and
testing of the 
isomorphic grammars for our three languages Dutch, English and Spanish.

\end{enumerate}

\bigskip

\subsection{Formalism}


The formal definition of the Rosetta3 modules has been completed 
now, except for 
the treatment of semi-idioms (e.g. {\it make a decision}), where the
translation of the predicate ({\it make}) depends on a very specific 
argument ({\it  decision}). The proposal on semi-idioms described in 
document 213 turned out to be hard to implement in an efficient way,
an alternative proposal is under discussion.

\bigskip


The notation for defining the rules of the interlingua (including
the parameters of the rules) has been fixed (doc. R0250). 
The notation for defining the transfer relation between M-rules
and interlingua rules has been fixed too.


\bigskip

In the morphological formalism a few minor extensions have been made.

In the first place provisions have been made to deal with fixed idioms.
Fixed idioms are expressions consisting of a sequence of strings
(e.g. the preposition {\it with respect to}), 
but which - from a syntactic and a semantic point of view -
may be considered one word.

In the second place the notation of segmentation rules
was extended in order to make the morphological component suitable for 
dealing with phonetic (instead of orthographic) representations. 
(Currently a student-trainee writes a variant of the Dutch morphological
component for phonetic representations). 
 

\subsection{Software}

{\bf Morphological modules.} 

The algorithms for A-MORPH and G-MORPH 
had already been completed in the previous half-year. In this period
only a few minor additions in the algorithm and the rule compilers
have been made. They relate to the above-mentioned
extensions of the formalism for dealing  with fixed idioms and phonetic
representations.

\bigskip

{\bf Syntactic modules} 

The M-rule compiler which converts the M-rules from their original
notation into Pascal, for both analysis and generation, has been 
completed and tested.

The algorithms for M-PARSER and M-GENERATOR have 
been implemented and integrated with the results of the
rule compiler for M-rules. These algorithms follow the formal definitions
in a rather straightforward way, with one exception. The regular expressions
which control the application of rules in a sub-grammar are not interpreted
by M-PARSER (c.q. M-GENERATOR), but there is an initiation phase during
which the order of rule applications is expressed in terms of successor
relations between the rules (This way of defining the order 
is formally equivalent, but more difficult to use for humans)
The algorithms M-PARSER and M-GENERATOR make use of this successor 
relation. This approach leads to a simpler and more efficient implementation. 

The current implementation cannot yet deal with idiomatic expressions.

\bigskip

The algorithm LEAVES has been implemented. This is the simplest
module of the system. It converts a surface tree into the sequence of its
leaves, i.e. the subtrees corresponding to words.


\bigskip

{\bf Transfer modules}

Rule compilers for specifying the rules of the interlingua and
the transfer rules have been developed (doc. R0250).

A version of the algorithms A-TRANSFER and 
G-TRANSFER has been implemented, in which semi-idioms are not taken into
account yet. This version includes disambiguating interaction in case
of ambiguous basic expressions. (Interaction with the user for solving
ambiguities was not planned for the Rosetta3 phase of the project, but
for the Rosetta4 phase. Rosetta3 only has to give all possible translations.
However, if a sentence contains a number of ambiguous words, the number of
possible translations may become very large. By adding the possibility
to let the user choose interactively between the possible meanings of a word,
the output of the system can be reduced to a manageable number.)

\bigskip

{\bf Miscellaneous}

Provisions have been made 
for creating a short-cut between M-PARSER and M-GENERATOR
of the same language, which is useful  for testing purposes.

A number of test tools has been implemented, e.g. for tracing rule
applications in M-PARSER and M-GENERATOR. Software for filling
and compiling 
the test dictionaries has been implemented (doc. R0249).

Procedures for extracting information from the Van Dale dictionaries have been 
implemented.

\bigskip



{\bf Recapitulation}

The algorithms and the rule compilers for the analysis
component of Rosetta3
(including the modules A-MORPH, S-PARSER, M-PARSER, A-TRANSFER) 
and the generation component 
(including the modules G-MORPH, LEAVES, M-GENERATOR, G-TRANSFER) 
have been implemented, except for some special provisions needed for
idioms and semi-idioms. In addition a number of tools, for software
management and for testing, have been implemented. 
As a result one of the goals of the Rosetta3
phase of the project has been achieved now: a translator-generator has been
constructed in such a way that by supplying linguistic rules and dictionary
entries for two languages, a new instance of the Rosetta3 translation
system is generated. However, there is still much work to be done,
especially on documentation, instruction, user-friendliness and efficiency.


\bigskip






\subsection{Linguistics}

{\bf Morphological rules}

The morphological rules for Spanish have been tested (for Dutch and English
this has already been done in the previous period). Because for Spanish only
a generative component is developed and morphological generation is the last
step in this component, the problem was that testing would have to wait
until all other modules would be ready. The input for the generative 
morphological component consists of rather complicated tree structures,
so entering these expressions manually is not an attractive alternative.
Therefore it was decided to make an analytical version of the morphological
rules too and to test the rules by making a short-cut between
analytical and generative morphology, in a similar way as for Dutch and English.
Thanks to the reversibility of the rules this took little extra
time. 

As a result we have now complete sets of morphological rules
for inflection of Dutch, English 
and Spanish, for both analysis and generation.

\bigskip



{\bf Syntactic and semantic rules}

\bigskip

\begin{enumerate}

\item {\bf Word translator.}
The local English M-rules for the word translator - a simple version
of Rosetta3 for the translation of isolated inflected words - have been
written (doc. R0233). 
The Dutch and the English rules have been tested for a Dutch-to-Dutch
and an English-to-English shortcut between M-PARSER and M-GENERATOR. 
have been completed. 
 The 
testing of the translation relation had to wait until the transfer 
modules were implemented, but this part of the test will be fairly simple.
For Spanish no word translator will be made in this phase of the project
(this follows from the decision to have only a small test dictionary for
Spanish).

\bigskip

\item {\bf Phrase translator.}
Most of the current linguistic efforts are related to writing M-rules
for the phrase translator, for Dutch, English (analysis and generation)
and Spanish (only generation).

Most rules for the Dutch clause, the adjective phrase and a preliminary
version of the noun phrase have been written, 
syntactically checked and translated into correct Pascal. The actual testing
of the rules has started recently. In addition the surface rules for 
Dutch have been written and tested.

Writing English and Spanish rules has started too. They are syntactically 
checked and compiled into Pascal; the actual testing will have to wait 
until the Dutch analysis component is operational.

In parallel with the writing of the M-rules the semantic rules
of the interlingua and the relation between the M-rules and the
interlingua, used in A-TRANSFER and G-TRANSFER, are specified.

\item {\bf Other linguistic work.}
The status of the work on the Van Dale dictionaries is extensively described in
doc. R0247. For each attribute of the open categories (noun, verb, adjective,
adverb) it has been investigated whether and how its values can be derived
from the Van Dale dictionaries. In addition it has been investigated to what 
extent the information in the dictionaries Dutch-Dutch, Dutch-English and
English-Dutch can be merged. The conclusion was that - because of the
numerous irregularities, exceptions and mismatches between the three 
dictionaries - too much handwork is needed for converting the Van Dale 
dictionaries into Rosetta dictionaries, even for the word translator 
(cf. the remarks on dictionaries in subsection 3.3).
We will use the procedures developed for extracting information from the Van 
Dales, but only for a small subset, for which corrections can be made by
hand. For the closed
categories (articles, pronouns etc.) all words from Van Dale will
be included in our dictionaries, but the morphological and syntactic
information will be entered manually.


For testing purposes a test dictionary is maintained. 

\bigskip

Two student-trainees of the University of Utrecht are doing linguistic studies
in the framework of Rosetta. 

The first study concerns the characterisation and
the translation
of generic expressions. An example: 
the translation of the noun phrase {\it pearls} into
Spanish is {\it perlas} if it must be interpreted as existential quantification
(as in {\it he gave her pearls}), 
but it is
{\it las perlas} if the noun phrase is used generically (as in {\it pearls are 
expensive} ).

In the second study a version of Dutch morphology is written for 
phonetic representations instead of orthographic representations.
This work may be useful for speech recognition and synthesis and
also for spelling correction.

\section{Management aspects}



\subsection{Personnel}


In the period from August 1, 1987 - February 1, 1988 the following people were
involved in the project.
\begin{verbatim}

drs. E. Appelo                           (Philips Nat. Lab.) 
drs. F.M.G. de Jong (8/10)               (Univ. of Utrecht)
drs. E.L. van Munster                    (Univ. of Utrecht)
drs. J.E. Odijk                          (Univ. of Utrecht)
drs. M.J. Sanders                        (Univ. of Utrecht)
drs. A.Y. Schenk                         (Univ. of Utrecht)
drs. H.E. Smit                           (Univ. of Utrecht)

\end{verbatim}

E. Appelo is a Philips employee since January 1, 1988.

Both C. Fellinger and A. Schenk participated in the start-up phase
of a new pre-development project on work stations (cf. subsection 3.3)
in the period October 1987 - January 1988. 
Fellinger has joined this project definitively and leaves a vacancy
in the Rosetta project. 

J. Medema, who had joined the Rosetta project 
temporarily, for work related to Van Dale and
software management, has moved to a new research activity.
He will continue to work for Rosetta about one day a week.

\bigskip

Student-trainees:
\begin{verbatim}
J. Zwarts (Univ. of Utrecht), from September 1, 1987.
J. Schipper (Univ. of Utrecht), from September 1, 1987.

C. Hazenberg completed his doctoral thesis in September 1987.

\end{verbatim}

Dr. J. Groenendijk (University of Amsterdam) 
continued his two-year study on text-semantics, financed by
Philips Research Laboratories.

\subsection{Internal organisation of the project}


The internal organisation of the project 
did not change in the past half-year.

There is a software subgroup currently consisting of only two people: 
Rous (chairman) and Leermakers. 

There is a linguistic subgroup, 
consisting of: Odijk (chairman), Appelo, 
De Jong, Van Munster, Sanders, Schenk and Smit.

There are regular progress meetings of the project team as a whole and of the 
subgroups.
In addition there are incidental meetings for the discussion of new
documents.

\subsection{Planning}


In the previous report (doc. R0216) we already mentioned the fact that in thes 
implementation and testing phase
of the project our cpu capacity has turned out to be insufficient
and that this has caused a delay. Because of this it was decided to
continue the Rosetta work on a new configuration, a cluster of two 785 VAXes. 
The new situation will start at the end of February 1988. We expect
that the new configuration will relieve, although not completely solve
 our problems.

Other causes for the delay of the project were described in the previous 
report. An additional cause is the departure of Fellinger from the project.

\bigskip

NEHEM has given permission to shift the final date when the 
Dutch-English and the Dutch-Spanish test 
version must be ready, to November 1,
1988. Our next report to NEHEM 
will be the final report which will be delivered before 
December 31, 1988. 

\bigskip

In the remaining period the small software group of Rosetta will
be concerned mainly with supporting the linguists during the testing
phase and adjusting the rule compilers, the software management system
(which has to manage more than 5000 files at the moment) 
and other software tools if necessary. In addition the 
following topics have the highest
priority:

\bigskip

- Documentation. Some parts of the software have been hardly documented,
because getting the system running had the highest priority until
recently. It is important that adequate documentation is written soon.

\bigskip

- Additions for dealing with idioms and semi-idioms.

\bigskip

- Test tools. During the testing of the linguistic rules, needs for
new tools arise occasionally. 

\bigskip

- Robustness measures. The system as it has been implemented now is only capable
of dealing with phrases that are correct with respect to the current grammar.
If an input phrase is incorrect or if it contains an unknown word, no
translation will be given at all. Robustness (or: fail-soft) measures are
needed for ensuring that at least a partial (possibly: word by word)
translation of   the input
phrase is given. 

\bigskip

For the linguistic work in the next half year a detailed planning has been
made (doc. R0251). We have opted for an incremental approach, where a narrow
path through a sub-grammar is tested first and then extensions are made step by 
step.

\subsection{Miscellaneous}

With respect to the transfer of the Rosetta research results to Philips product
divisions the prospects are favourable. A joint project
of product division TDS and research has started recently in which 
advanced work stations will be developed.
Presumably natural language
applications, based on the Rosetta approach, 
 will play an important role in this project. Two members of the Rosetta team
have participated in the preparatory phase of the work station project.

There is a reasonable chance that our dictionary problem (the
problem that filling large dictionaries cannot be realized in a research 
project, while on the other hand they are an absolute necessity for 
demonstrating the capacities of a translation system) will be solved
in this way. For the natural language applications on the work station
large lexical data bases will have to be constructed, which will 
be useful for research 
purposes as well.

\section{Documents of the past half-year}

Since the project is in its implementation phase and most of the work 
is related to implementing and testing, the number of produced 
documents is smaller than it used to be.
