$C1 Introduction
$ This note deals with the issue of how to account for the interpretation of
nonovert subjects of infinitives, other nonfinite forms (participles,
gerunds) and certain xpprop-s in Rosetta3.$

$ In Rosetta2 nonovert subjects of infinitives and of OPENXP-'s are variables
up to the point where they are linked to some antecedent. At that point (at the
point where the S-tree containing the variable is substituted) these variables
are deleted. This strategy works fine for certain cases, but not for all.$ 

$ This note discusses cases, for which the approach taken in Rosetta2 is not
appropriate. Furthermore, for the cases where the Rosetta2 approach is
appropriate, a change in this approach is proposed.$

$ First, the notion _control_ is described, and divided into two subtypes,
Obligatory Control (OC)  and Non Obligatory Control (NOC), (section 2).
Second, control in Rosetta3 is discussed. A proposal is made for dealing
with OC in Rosetta3 (3.1); the basic facts w.r.t. NOC are discussed (3.2)
and summarized in (3.3). In section 4 a first proposal for the treatment of NOC
in Rosetta3 is made. In (5) certain translational problems w.r.t control are
discussed and (partial) solutions to them suggested. In (6) a revised  proposal
is made, in which the translational problems discussed in (5) are taken into 
account.$

$C1 Control

$ Usually infinitives and other nonfinite forms  (and certain xpprop's) do not
have subjects at the surface. Nevertheless, one can show that it is at least
convenient, and in some cases unavoidable to have a subject in infinitival
clauses at some 'deeper' level of representation. In Rosetta3, this subject
will be a variable at this 'deeper' level, that will disappear in the course of
the derivation. Furthermore, often this variable has an antecedent higher up in
the structure, which is, at the point in the derivation relevant to the
discussion here, also a variable$ 
$ We call the variable functioning as the subject of an infinitive (or XPPROP)
that will not be substitued for later on in the derivation the _controllee_ or
_PRO_. We will call the variable that functions as the antecedent of the
controllee the _controller_. The relation between controller and controllee is
called the _control relation_, or simply _control_$ 

Example.  VAR tried [ VAR to leave ]
           |           |
       controller   controllee
           |             |
           |---control---|
             
$ There are two types of the control relation, called _Obligatory Control_ (OC)
and _Non Obligatory Control_ (NOC) respectively. In LFG, the partially 
corresponding relevant terms are _Functional Control_ and _Anaphoric Control_
respectively.$

$ The terminology Obligatory Control versus Non obligatory Control
is due to Edwin Williams 1980. Some other relevant literature on
this subject is Koster (1984), Bresnan (1982),
Rita Manzini (TLR and unpublished diss.), Culicover and Wilkins,$
$NP
$C2 Obligatory Control

$ The first type of control, called _Obligatory Control_ has the following
properties:$ 

$ a) There must be a controller present in the syntactic tree$
$ b) The controller must c-command the controllee. In particular, this 
implies that the controller cannot be inside a PP$
$ c) There is exactly one controller for the controllee, i.e. there cannot
be so-called split antecedents.$
$ d) The 'distance' between controller and controllee is very small, in a
sense that can be defined more precisely in structural terms: For control
in particular this implies that the controller is maximally one sentence higher
than the controllee$ 

$ In Dutch, a controllee is subject to Obligatory Control if it is
the subject of a raised infinitive (by Verb Raising). If an infinitive is
extraposed, then it is not subject to Obligatory Control. Therefore the
properties mentioned can be illustrated by the following minimal pairs:$ 

Property (a) 
  (1)a.  dat ik iets beveel
     b.  dat ik iemand iets beveel
     c. *dat ik de auto's beveel te repareren
     d.  dat ik hem de auto's beveel te repareren
  (2)a. *er werden boeken proberen te lezen
        *er werden boeken geprobeerd te lezen
     
Property (b)
  (3)a. ..dat hij deze boeken probeerde te lezen
     b.*..dat er door hem deze boeken geprobeerd werd te lezen
     c.*..dat er door hem deze boeken werd proberen te lezen

Property (c)
  (4) *..dat Jan Piet samen hielp te ontvluchten

Property (d)
  (5)* .. dat hij zei dat ik zich moest schamen

$ The examples in (1) show that the verb _bevelen_ can take a direct object
and optionally an indirect object. If a subordinate infinitive contains
a controllee, subject to obligatory control, then the controller (in the case
of bevelen: the indirect object) must be present (= property (a)). Notice that
one cannot say that _bevelen_, when combined with an infinitive, obligatorily
requires an indirect object to be present, for if the controllee is not subject
to obligatory control, then it need not be present:  _Hij heeft bevolen de
auto's te maken._$
$ The examples in (2) show that if the antecedent subject is not present
(removed due to fact that it is in the passive construction), an infinitive
containing a PRO, subject to obligatory control, cannot appear (=property (a)).
Infinitives containing a PRO that is not subject to obligatory control are
possible after by-phrase less passives: _Er werd geprobeerd boeken te lezen_$ 

$ The examples in (3) show that a verb that allows an argument to appear either
in a PP or simply as an NP (in this case dependent on the passiveness of
the verb form), disallows this argument in a PP if it is a controller for some
PRO, subject to obligatory control. (property (b)). If PRO is not subject to
obligatory control, then this is possible, cf. _Er werd door hem geprobeerd
deze boeken te lezen_$

$ The example in (4) illustrates the property (c). The presence of _samen_
indicates that the subject of _ontvluchten_ must be plural. Since it is
a PRO, subject to obligatory control, it must have a controller. There
is no plural controller, so the only possibility to save the structure is
by making both _Jan_ and _Piet_ the controllers. But even this does not save 
the structure. Notice that if the infinitive contains a PRO, not subject to 
obligatory control, the sentence is fine: ..dat Jan Piet hielp samen te
ontvluchten$

$ Finally, the _zich_ in example (5) shows that the subject of _schamen_
must bear the feature _person:3_. Since the subject is a PRO, subject to
obligatory control, the controller must bear this feature as well. The
pronoun _ik_, of course, does not do so, but the pronoun _hij_ does.
Nevertheless, the pronoun _hij_ apparently cannot function as the controller
for the controllee. If we exchange _hij_ and _ik_, the sentence becomes
grammatical:$ 
$nl 1
$ ..dat ik zei dat hij zich moest schamen,$
$nl 1
$ clearly indicating that the _hij_ in the original example was 'too distant'
in some sense to be made precise.$
$nl 1
$ In Dutch PRO is subject to obligatory control if verb raising has applied.
Since this is only possible if the infinitival sentence is a complement
of V, a sentence functioning as a subject, or as a complement to NOUN or
Adjective cannot contain a PRO, subject to Obligatory Control$
$ Furthermore, the subject variable of ADJPPROP-s, ADVPPROP-s, PREPPPROP-s
is always subject to obligatory control in such cases as 'Ik at _het vlees_
_rauw_', 'Ik legde _de boeken_ _in de kast_', 'ik verfde _de deur_ _groen_'$
$nl 1
$ In English PRO is subject to obligatory control in the following cases:
if no overt subject instead of PRO is possible (i.e. e.g. no obligatory
control in the complement of verbs that take for+infinitive complements
(_want_, _prefer_)) and the relevant sentence is a complement of V (i.e.
no subject, not a complement of NOUN, ADJ )$

$ Furthermore, it seems that adverbial infinitival and participal sentences,
often contain a PRO subject to obligatory control$
$NP
$C2 Non Obligatory Control
$ Apart from cases of Obligatory Control, there  are the cases of
Non Obligatory Control. (OC vs. NOC)$
$ NOC does not show any of the properties of OC:$

$ a) There need not be a controller$
$ b) If there is an controller, then it need not c-command the controllee$
$ c) There can be more than one controller, i.e. split antecedents can occur$
$ d) The distance between controller and controllee is not structurally limited
in any way$

$ Some examples have been given already. They are repeated here for convenience,
and some others have been added$

$ Property (a)$
(6) Hij heeft bevolen de auto's te maken.
(7) Er werd geprobeerd boeken te lezen 

$ Property (b)$
(8) ..dat er door hem geprobeerd werd deze boeken te lezen

$ Property (c)$
(9) ..dat Jan Piet hielp samen te ontvluchten
(10) ..dat Jan Piet vroeg dit samen te doen

$ Property (d)$
(11) John zei dat het onmogelijk was zich te gedragen onder zulke omstandigheden

$ The reference for a NOC PRO is determined in a way reminiscent of the 
determination of the reference of overt personal pronouns, whereas the 
determination of the reference of OC PRO is reminiscent of reflexive pronouns$

$ The four properties distinguishing OCP from NOCP show up in exactly the
same way if we compare the properties of personal pronouns with reflexive
pronouns.$
$nl 1
$ Property (a):$
     (12)a.* _Himself_ left (* He self left)
        b.  He left
$ Property (b):$
     (13)a.* _John's_ mother saw _himself_
        b.  _John's_ mother saw _him_
$ Property (c)$
     (14 a.*_John_ told _Bill_ about _themselves_
        b. _John_ told _Bill_ that _they_ had to leave together
$ Property (d)$
     (15 a.*_John_ thought that I would kill _himself_
        b. _John_ thought that I would kill _him_
 
$ Basically, one can state that the reference of NOC PRO and personal pronouns
is determined by syntactic, pragmatic and discourse rules, while the reference
of OC PRO and reflexive pronouns is determined exclusively by syntactic rules$ 

$ In Dutch and English Non obligatory control occurs whenever obligatory
control does not hold. (The list of cases of obligatory control given above
is claimed to be exhaustive). In particular, :$
- in extraposed infinitivals
- in infinitivals functioning as a subject
- in all infinitivals that start with an overt conjunction or can start with
an overt conjunction or that start a wh-word (overt or nonovert): om-zinnen,
dependent interrogative infinitives, infinitival relatives , which start with a
nonovert wh-word ( de boeken _om te lezen_ liggen op tafel), om-zinnen dependent
on the word _te_ (het boek is  te zwaar _om op te tillen_)
- as complements of nonverbs (Adj: hij is blij _samen te kunnen vertrekken_,
Noun: een poging _om deze problemen op te lossen_)
  
$NP
$C1 Control in Rosetta

$ There are three problems for Rosetta(3):$

$ 1) How do we determine the controller for OC PRO?$
$ 2) How do we determine the controller for NOC PRO, if there is one,
and what is its interpretation if there is not one?$
$ 3) How do we deal with mismatches between OC and NOC in two languages?$


$ Of these problems, 1) is relatively simple to solve, but 2) and 3) are more
difficult.$ 

$C2 Obligatory Control in Rosetta

$ Given the fact that the relation between controller and OC PRO is 
determined by syntactic conditions only, this is the easiest case to deal
with. We can simply adopt the method used in Rosetta2, i.e. upon substitution
of the S-tree containing the controllee, it is checked whether the required
syntactic relation holds between the controller and the controllee or not.
If this relation holds, the rule is applicable and it deletes the controllee, 
else the rule yields the null set. As in Rosetta2, the controllee gets its
features by the pre-action. It is necessary to split this rule into a
rule and a number of transformations. This has been done in the subgrammar 
proposal. The reason for this is, that deletion of the controllee can be
done only after one knows how the inserted infinitive has been incorporated
into the the higher sentence (by verb raising or by extraposition), since this
determines whether the controllee is subject to obligatory control or
not.$ 
$ I propose to adopt one crucial change relative to the treatment in Rosetta2,
which concerns the order of application of this rule relative to rules that
form the passive. In Rosetta2 the substitution rule that achieves the 
determination of the controller of the controllee is 'ordered after' the
voice rules (of course, strictly spoken, rules are not ordered in Rosetta2,
but the CL-numbering does achieve the effect as if the are). This is wrong.
One can see this quite simply. The verb that takes the controller as 
an argument is specified in such a way that it is clear what grammatical 
relation the controller must bear to be able to function as a controller.
E.g. the verb _beloven_ has specified somehow that the controller must
bear the _subject_ relation; the verb _bevelen_ has specified somehow that
the controller must bear the relation _indirect object_, etc. After the
application of voice rules, the grammatical relation an element bears can have
been changed (e.g. obj --> subj, etc.) It turns out to be the case, however,
that the original grammatical relation is relevant for the determination
of the control relationship in some cases, whereas in other cases the
resulting grammatical relation is relevant. For this reason, no  ordering
relation can be defined between the passive rule and the rule that takes care 
of the control relation. The solution to this problem is to split up the
passive rule into two parts  ( there are also independent reasons for doing
this, cf. a.o. ergatives) , and to apply the rule that takes care of
control between these two parts. This has been done in the subgrammar
proposal. The first part is called RC:Subject Demotionrules. The second part
is called TC:ObjOKrules$
$ In Rosetta2, the problem indicated indeed leads to cases that cannot be 
handled adequately, e.g. though the sentence _ik dwong hem zich te scheren_ can
be handled adequately, its passive counterpart _hij werd gedwongen zich te
scheren_ cannot. Similarly, in English _I forced him to shave_ succeeds, whereas
_he was forced to shave_ does not.$
$ It is necessary to assume Verb Preposition reanalysis in English in certain
cases, to guarantee the property of c-command,  e.g. in _Mary relies on John to
dress himself_ (Appendix C (26)). But such a reanalysis is necessary anyway, see
the independent evidence for such a reanalysis in Appendix C, examples 
(27-29) .$ 
$ Strictly spoken, up to now it has not been shown yet definitively, that
OCP-interpretation must apply before ObjectOKrules. If we do not
order them before these rules, then the characterization of control restrictions
must apply in a somewhat different fashion. See appendix A$
$ The examples in (16), however,  show that control must apply before Object-OK
rules. In example (16)b., the NOUNP _Mary_ c-commands the predicate _nude_
after the application ObjectOKrules, but not before. The ungrammaticality of
this example shows that the c-command relation before application of Object Ok
rules is the relevant relation (at least in the case of secondary predicates):$

(16)a. *I talked about _Mary_ _nude_
    b. *_Mary_ was talked about _nude_
    c.  Mary was talked about

(example from Culicover and Wilkins)

$C2 Non Obligatory Control in Rosetta

$ Strictly spoken, NOC PRO behaves as a personal pronoun, so that its 
interpretation (its reference) should be accounted for in the same way as
the reference of personal pronouns is accounted for. Discourse semantics 
and/or pragmatics play a crucial role here$

$ Nevertheless, it seems necessary to take some measures in the grammar, since
the option of ignoring the differences in meaning (as is done in the case of
overt personal pronouns) is not always available. This is so,  because in in
certain cases the nonovert pronoun must be translated into an overt pronoun, or
because in cases of agreement (with adjectives, or with reflexives) or other
cooccurrence restrictions (such as w.r.t. reciprocals and adverbs such as
_samen_ overt forms must be chosen, so that all ambiguities must be made
explicit.$ 

$ In the case of NOC two subcases must be distinguished: 1) There is no
syntactic element that can function as an antecedent, and 2) there is a
syntactic element that can function as an antecedent$ 

$C3 NOC without an antecedent
$C4 Complements of verbs

_+WH-complements_

$ Some examples are:$

(17)a. It has been asked how to get there
    b. It was forgotten where to turn off the main road
    c. It was understood how to do that
     
If the subject is missing as an antecedent, then it is interpreted as _one_,
cf. It has been asked how to behave *myself/?yourself / *himself / oneself
?ourselves / *yourselves / *themselves.$ 
$ ??? Otherwise(?) as any person or number$

_-WH-complements_

$ Here we distinguish two subcases. 1) Cases where a subject controller is
left out, as e.g. in passives, and 2) cases where a direct object or an 
indirect object is left out. Examples are in (18) and (19):$

(18)a. Er werd geprobeerd een oplossing te vinden
    b. It was preferred to have dinner at 6. (=Ap. 51)
    c. It was arranged to have dinner at 6. (=Ap. 52 )
    d. It was decided to have dinner at 6. (=Ap. 53)
    e. Er werd besloten om om zes uur te dineren
    f. Er werd de voorkeur aan gegeven om om 6 uur te dineren
(19)a. Er werd gevraagd je(zelf)  in gezelschap te gedragen
    b. Er werd bevolen elkaar te doden.
    c. Hij vroeg dit te doen
    d. Hij stelde voor iets anders te doen
    e. Louise signaled to follow her (=Ap. 22)
    f. My teacher suggested to take another topic  (=Ap. 62)

$ For the cases containing an impersonal passive where a subject controller has
been left out, it seems to be the case that there is no ambiguity: the subject
variable is interpreted as _men_: er werd  vermeden / verzuimd / vergeten /
geweigerd / geprobeerd / gewenst zich op dit probleem te storten; er werd
gehoopt / beweerd / gemeend / gevreesd  zich op dit probleem te moeten storten;
The reciprocal pronoun _elkaar_ can appear (cf. _men keek elkaar aan_) and the
reflexive pronoun seems to have to be _zich_ , as is to be expected if the
subject has the features of _men_ (cf. men kan _zich_ vergissen) or :
(Is an interpretation as _wij_ possible here?)$

(18)a. Er werd geprobeerd elkaar te doden
    b  Er werd geprobeerd *mezelf/*jezelf/ zichzelf/*onszelf/*julliezelf
       te verrijken/ zich  mooi te kleden
    c. Er werd besloten  zich op dit probleem te werpen
    d. Er werd de voorkeur aan gegeven zich  mooi te kleden

$ The cases where a direct object or an indirect object is missing seem to have
a pronoun with the features of the pronoun (generic) _je_ as the subject of the
infinitive, or any other personal pronoun cf. ik heb bevolen _zich_ aan te
kleden; hij heeft aangeraden _ons_ naar een advocaat te spoeden; So these cases
should be treated as fully ambiguous.$
$ I propose to treat these cases as being cases where a full pronoun is 
substituted for the variable in the infinitive clause, and where in the
first of the two subcases a special rule of NOC-PRO interpretation filters
all forms except the _men_ interpretation and the _wij_ interpretation. In the
second subcase all pronouns are allowed. This rule of NOCP-interpretation 
also deletes the pronouns$

    d. The account of how to take care of such problems was unconvincing.
    e. The problem of how to get the piano through the doorway baffled him

$ In these cases the subjects can be interpreted as any pronoun, including
_one_, cf 'The question of how to behave myself / yourself / himself /
oneself / ourselves / yourselves / themselves remained unanswered'.

(23)a. It is unclear what to do
    b. It was unclear what to do with herself now that Molly was gone (=Ap. 74)
    c. It is clear how to get there

$ These cases are in fact enormously ambiguous, e.g. the first example
(containing a so called arbitrary PRO) can mean _It is unclear what
I / you / he / she / we / you / they / one  should do_. For these, it seems
best, and in fact required, to treat them as fully ambiguous, cf. 'It was 
unclear what to do with myself / yourself / himself / herself / ourselves /
yourselves / themselves, now that ...'.$

$ Some examples are:$

(28)a. This book has been sold to get some money
    b. Dit boek is verkocht om wat geld bij elkaar te krijgen
    c. Er werd een boek gekocht om mee te spelen

$ The subject of the infinitive can be of any person and number, if it contains
a wh-gap, cf. Er werd een boek gekocht om me / je / zich /ons /jullie op te 
storten. Otherwise, either there is an overt antecedent, or (as in (28)a.,b.
the subject can be of any person and number: 'Het huis is verkocht om me / je

$ The subject of the infinitive can be of any person and number, cf. (29)c.$ 

$C3 NOC with an antecedent

$ Consider the following pair of sentences:$

(30)a. He wanted to leave at six o'clock
    b. He wanted us to leave at six o'clock

$ These sentences are syntactically identical except for the distinction
empty subject of the infinitive / nonempty subject of the infinitive.
Notice that the subject of the infinitive of (30)a. can be interpreted as
the referent of _he_, or as a group containing the referent of _he_. It cannot
be interpreted as the referent of _us_.But that interpretation cannot be
ruled out by rules of discourse semantics or pragmatics, since this is the
interpretation of (30)b., which is discourse semantically and pragmatically
well formed under certain conditions. We must conclude that the interpretation
of the subject of the infinitive _to leave_ as _us_ in (30)a. is ruled out by
other principles than principles of pragmatics or discourse semantics. We 
investigate here what the exact statement of such rules should be.$ 

$C4 Complements of verbs
_+WH-complements_

$ Some examples are:$

(31)a. He did not know what to do
    b. I wonder how to get there
    c. I forgot where to turn off the main road
    d. I don't see how to stop him
    e. I didn't remember when to turn around.
    f. I'll inquire how to get there
    g. I don't understand how to do that

(other relevant verbs: consider, decide, discover, find out, guess, learn,
observe, perceive, settle, think )
$ In these cases the interpretations are either to take the reference of PRO
to be equal to the reference of the argument of the verb, or to take its 
reference to be a group of persons containing the argument of the verb, or
to take it as having no specific reference at all (_one_), cf. 'I don't know
how to get to know myself / *yourself / *himself / ourselves / *yourselves 
/ *themselves / oneself'.
$ The same is true if there are two arguments: here one of the arguments
functions as the controller, cf.$ 

(32)a. I asked him what to do
    b. I explained to him how to get there
    c. I told him how to get there
    d. I showed them how to do this.
    e. I didn't ask what to do
    f. I taught him how to do that

$ Maybe, however, the reference of the PRO can be a group containing the other
argument. If so, then if the other argument has a 'lower' person, then 
'lower person' plurals become possible, e.g. 
' I showed  him how to behave *myself / *yourself / himself / ourselves /
*yourselves / themselves in public', where the reflexive _ourselves_ is OK
because of the presence of the noncontroller argument _I_ (person:1) which has
a 'lower person' than _him_ (person:3).$
$ In Dutch such constructions do not exist, or are extremely marginal$

_-WH-complements_

$ Here we distinguish two subcases. 1) Cases where a subject controller is
left out, as e.g. in passives, and 2) cases where a direct object or an 
indirect object is left out. Examples are in (33) and (34):$

(33)a. Er werd (wel) door hem geprobeerd er zich iets bij voor te stellen,
       (maar het lukte niet zo best)
    b. Er werd mij gevraagd me te gedragen / ons rustig te houden 
    c. Er werd mij opgedragen dit samen te doen
    d. Er werd door de informateur geprobeerd een oplossing te vinden
    e. It was preferred by the committee to have dinner at 6. 
    f. It was arranged by the committee to have dinner at 6. 
    g. It was decided by the committee to have dinner at 6. (=Ap. 53a)
    h. Er werd besloten door de jongen om om zes uur te dineren
    i. Er werd door hem de voorkeur aan gegeven om om 6 uur te dineren

(34)a. Er werd gevraagd je(zelf)  in gezelschap te gedragen
    b. Er werd ons bevolen elkaar te doden.
    c. Hij heeft ons gevraagd dit te doen
    d. Hij stelde hem voor iets anders te doen
    e. Louise signaled Tom to follow her (=Ap. 21)
    f. The  teacher suggested to me to take another topic  (=Ap. 61)

$ In these cases the subject of the infinitive is most normally interpreted as
the person referred to by the antecedent, or as a group containing the person
referred to by the antecedent, cf. e.g. 'Hij heeft mij gevraagd me / *je /
*zich / ons rustig te houden tot de wedstrijd afgelopen was'$ 

$C4 Complements of nouns
_WH-complements_

$ Some examples:$

(35)a. John's question of what to do under such circumstances remained
       unanswered 
    b. I posed the question of what to do 
    c. He had no idea of how to tackle this problem
    d. His account of how to take care of such problems was unconvincing.
    e. Our problem of how to get the piano through the doorway baffled him
    f. I asked him about the problem of how to get all this done in time
 
$ In these cases the subject of the infinitive is most normally interpreted as
the person referred to by the antecedent, as a group containing the person
referred to by the antecedent, or as _one_. If the specifier position of the
noun phrase has been filled by a possesive NP, or a possessive pronoun. then
this NP is the antecedent, otherwise the antecedent seems to be taken
freely from the sentence the NP is contained in,( although it, apparently,
must be an argument of the verb of this sentence (cf. 'My teacher asked her
about the problem of how to get there on time'. PRO <> _my_ ??)$

$ If there are two arguments, then control behaves as it would do with the
related verbs, cf. _my question to Peter of how to get this done in time_$

_-WH-complements_

$ Some relevant examples:$

(36)a. John's plans to kill the ayatollah were known to everyone
     b. We found plans to kill the  shah
     c. We had plans to kill the shah
     d. We designed these plans to kill the shah
     e. John's attempt to leave surprised us
     f. John left orders to follow Pete
     g. John left us orders to follow Pete 

$ If there is a possessive NP, then this possessive NP is the antecedent,
unless control properties of the noun state that some other argument of the
noun is the controller (cf. in 'My request to them to leave' _them_ is the
controller, not _my_). If there is no possessive NP, then the controller 
is chosen from the higher sentence, apparently depending on properties of the
verb. There some further restrictions, e.g. if the NP is a subject, 
cf 'The plans to kill him surprised her', where _her_ is not the controller
of the subject of _to kill him_.$ 

$C4 Complements of Adjectives

_WH-complements_

$ Some examples are:$

(37)a. It is unclear to us what to do.
    b. It is unclear to me how to behave myself/ *yourself/ *himself/ 
       ourselves/ *yourselves / *themselves / oneself in public

$ In these cases the subject of the infinitive is most normally interpreted as
the person referred to by the antecedent, as a group containing the person
referred to by the antecedent, or as _one_. In Dutch similar constructions do
not exist, or are extremely marginal.$ 


_-WH-complements_

$ Some examples are:$

(38)a. Hij is blij dat te kunnen doen
    b. Hij is het beu dat te doen.
    c. He is eager to do this. 
    d. He is anxious to go
    e. he was so kind to do that
    f. Het was moeilijk voor hem om dat te doen
    g. It was difficult for him to do that

$ Many adjectives can have two variants: _NP  Adj_ or _it Adj of NP_,
if at least _it-Adj_ is grammatical. cf.
it is *anxious / *eager / kind / stupid / foolish / unwise (_of him_)
het is *ijverig / *blij / aardig / stom / dom / onverstandig (_van hem_)
etc.. here the NP in _of NP_ (van NP) is the controller. (cf. Hornby 68:137)$
$ Often the subject is the controller. If a _voor_ or _for_ phrase is present,
then the VAR in this phrase usually is the controller, cf. (38)f.,g..The
subject of the infinitive is interpreted as referring to the refrence of the
controller or as referring to a group containing the reference
of the controller, cf. 'Hij was blij dat samen te kunnen doen', Ik ben blij
me / *je / *zich / ons / jullie op dit probleem te kunnen storten$ 


_Tough-construction_

$ Some examples are:$

(39)a. he is easy for us to please
    b. The problem is difficult for us to solve

(* are these grammatical??, cf. 'Dit probleem is moeilijk (*voor mij) om op
te lossen' *)
$ The subject is interpreted as the NP in the higher clause that is the
complement of the adjective, or as referring to a group containing the
reference of some NP in the clause$

$C4 Subject sentences

$ Some examples are:$

(40) To involve myself/ yourself/ himself / herself / ourselves / yourselves 
/ themselves / oneself in that issue would break her up

$ Apparently. The subject of the infinitive is fully ambiguous between all
persons, and numbers, and _one_ or _men_ is also possible, depending (a.o.)
on the time specification present in the sentence ( cf. Ap.74-78. 86-89)$ 
$ However, if the verb is passive (cf. Ap. 92), or if there is an adjective in
the sentence functioning as the main predicate, or a for-phrase, the argument
of the passive verb or  the adjective that normally functions as a controller
or the NP in the for -phrase seeems to be the controller:$ 

(41)a. To behave herself is difficult for her 
    b. To behave herself is a real problem for her

$C4 Infinitival relatives

(42) I saw the man to do the job with

$ If the subject of the relative is not coreferential with the NP that
it modifies, it is interpreted as coreferring to some NP in the clause,
or as referring to a group containing the reference of some NP in the clause,
or as _one_; in fact, just like interrogatives$

$C4 Purpose Clauses

(43) I was looking for a man to do the job with

$ If the purpose clause contains a wh-gap, then the subject is interpreted as
some NP in the higher clause, which is not the NP binding the Wh-gap, or
as referring to a group containing the reference of some NP in the clause, or
as _one_; in fact, just like interrogatives.$
$ If there is no wh-gap, then the subject is interpreted as some NP in the
higher clause, or as referring to a group containing the reference of some NP
in the clause$

$C4 Clauses dependent on Te/Too 

(44) he was too angry to be able to control himself

$ If the dependent clause contains a wh-gap, then the subject is interpreted as
some NP in the higher clause, which is not the NP binding the Wh-gap, or as
referring to a group containing the reference of some NP in the clause, or as
_one_; in fact, just like interrogatives$ 
$ If there is no wh-gap, then the subject is interpreted as some NP in the

$NP
$C1 A proposal for the treatment of NOC in Rosetta3

$ To  account for all these cases of nonobligatory control, I propose the
following:$ 

$ 1) The assumptions made in appendix A are adopted, i.e. the specification of
controllers is given in terms of the attribute _controller_ with values
( none, first, second, third ). In the start rules the controller index
is determined and assigned to the attribute _controller-index_.
$ In the case of infinitives that will be subject to NOCP an abstract pronoun
is substituted for the subject variable. There is full ambiguity between all
persons , numbers and genders, including the possibility for the pronoun
to be _one_, _men_ or _je_.$
$ 2) There is a transformation of NOCP interpretation that allows only sentences
containing pronouns as the subject of the infinitive, if they satisfycertain
conditions , according to the specification given in the table above. It
operates on structures of the form C[ ...H... S[ subj/PRO ... ] ... ], where C
is the category of the S-tree with H as a head where the sentential S-tree S
containing  an abstract pronoun PRO is substituted into. (We ignore temporarily
the nonlocal antecedents of subject pronouns of sentences in NP).$ 

$ First, we must determine whether there is an antecedent or not. We do so in
the following way:$ 

There is an antecedent: IF   there is a VARi in C with 
                             index = H.controller-index
                        THEN VARi is the antecedent
                        ELSE there is no antecedent

$ ( the VARi can be inside PREPP-s, e.g. in prepobj/..-s and in the 
byobj/PREPP)$
$ Furthermore we must determine the other classification criteria of 
the matrix: type of sentence, +/-Wh, +/-s (for CofV -Wh, 
if there is no antecedent). Next we must check the relevant conditions on
the pronoun$

$ A possible formulation of two such rules is given in appendix B$

$ The so-called long distance control is not accounted for explicitly in this
proposal, but it will fall out as a special case. It involves such cases as$
$nl 1
$ (45)  John said that it was difficult to shave himself$
$nl 1
$ In the approach sketched, _himself_ will be coindexed with the
(nonovert) subject of the infinitive. This in itself has no overt antecedent
at any level of representation, but the adjective _difficult_ is specified
with the feature controller-index= index of VAR that is the complement of
_difficult_ (_for someone_) that has been replaced by an EMPTY. This 
empty in itself can be coreferential to some
higher NP in the clause (as in (45)), but it need not be so, cf.
(46):$

$ (46) John said that it was difficult to shave herself, because she ...$ 

$ And even if there are cases where it is obligatory, then this is not to be 
accounted for by rules of syntax, but by rules of pragmatics or of discourse
semantics$

$ A switch of controllers, as in the sentences (90-98) from appendix C cannot be
handled$

$ Notice furthermore that the typing system must take care of the fact that
the controller and the controllee satisfy each other's type restrictions, e.g.
in 'The book has been sold to get some money' _the book_ does not satisfy
the type restriction of PRO, since PRO must be human, so that _the book_ is
not the controller of this PRO, in contrast to e.g. 'The boy has been sent away
to get some money'. Maybe this restriction must be imposed in the rules
of control, at least in the case of nonobligatory control. This should be 
looked into. It is not clear to me whether such a restriction can be 
taken care of easily in the case of obligatory control. Perhaps 
in IL a restriction  holds that states that variables with the same index
have to share their type restrictions.$ 
$NP
$C1 Translation of Controllee's 

$ As far as I can see there are no special problems in translating if OC in
language L1 matches OC in L2, and if NOC in L1 matches NOC in L2. Real 
problems turn up, however, in cases where OC must be translated into
NOC, or where NOC must be translated into OC. A typical case of this
latter possibility is: Er werd geprobeerd (door hem) dit probleem op te lossen
dat vertaald moet worden als _He tried to solve this problem_, resp. 
_One tried to solve this problem_.$

$ Ideally, there should  be a construction where the same type of control
can hold in the other language as well. In the case suggested, it maybe
exists, e.g. 'He made an attempt to solve this problem', An attempt was made
to solve this problem, although this translation seems to differ from 
'proberen' in aktionsart properties.$

$ We might also consider the possibility of dealing with NOCP in the case
that the subject of the infinitive happens to be coreferential with the 
antecedent without inserting an abstract pronoun. Instead we could treat such
cases in the same way as cases of OC (by binding a variable in the subject
position), although with the conditions on the controller-controllee relation
somewhat relaxed. e.g.:

er werd door VARi geprobeerd [ VARi dit probleem op te lossen ]

$ Then these cases of NOCP can be translated into cases of OCP, which seems 
desirable anyway. It would have the advantage that only some 'difficult' cases
of OCP-NOCP mismatches cannot be handled, and this only, because there is no
adequate translation, not because the system is incapable of giving the
adequate translation. To avoid superfluous ambiguities we should then exclude
that cases of NOCP where there is full identity in features between controller
and controllee are treated by pronoun insertion, i.e. e.g. the first T:NOCP
interpretation should be replaced by a transformation that has a VAR in
the subject position of the infinitive$

$ We might now assume that in the case of short passives (without a door-phrase)
upon EMPTY substitution a NOUNP containing _men_ is inserted, which can then
serve as a controller for a subject/VAR in the infinitive. A separate 
transformation, T:Doormendeletion, deletes this phrase after the application 
of the transformations of control. This makes it possible to translate 
'Er werd geprobeerd dit probleem op te lossen' into 'One tried to solve 
the problem'.$

$NP
$C1 Revised Proposal

$ On the basis of the discussion concerning the mismatches between OCP and
NOCP I revise the proposal made earlier in the following way:$

$ All assumptions from the former proposal are adopted, except:$

$ - If in the case of NOCP controller and controllee are fully identical in
features, then substitution of an abstract pronoun for the subject of
the infinitive will not lead to a well-formed structure. Instead, the
subject of the infinitive must consist of a variable with exactly the
same properties of its antecedent. Substitution of a pronoun in such cases
will not pass the control transformations. Transformations of the
form of the example transformation T: NOCP-interpretation1a are replaced
by transformations where the NOUNP{NOUNPREC1}[ head/PRO{PROREC1}] is
replaced by VAR{VARREC2}. Conditions are changed accordingly.$

$ - EMPTY-substitution for a subject/VAR results syntactically in the
insertion of a NOUNP[ head/ PERSPRO {*men*} ]. If the sentence is
passivized, then this NOUNP becomes the obj/ of the byobj/PREPP. There
is a transformation class, TC: Doormendeletion, die opereert na de
control regels, en die een byobj/PP die 'door men' bevat deleert (verplicht).$

$ The interaction between men-insertie, doormen-deletion and the attribute
_controller-index_ should be taken good care of: Maybe there is a problem
here.$


$ - The rules for OCP-interpretation and the rules of NOCP-interpretation
that do not apply to structures containing an abstract PRO can be translated
into each other$
$NP
$A1 Specification of Control restrictions

$ It is possible, in principle, to have the establishment of the control
relation apply after voice-rules, if we can somehow 'continue to remember' what
element functions as the controller. One way of doing this might be the
following. Instead of characterizing the controller in terms of grammatical
relations, we characterize the controller in terms of 'thematic relations'.
Now of course, in Rosetta there are no 'thematic relations', but we can
simulate such an approach in the following way:$
$ This would entail that we state which argument variable is the
controller, and then we should remember its index. E.g.$
$ Assume that the verb has the following attributes:$

verb attributes: controller :( none, first, second, third)  (inherent)
                 controller-index: indextype.

$ The startclause rules assign the index of the variable that is the
first/second/ third (variable) argument of this startclause rule to the
attribute controller-index. Later in the derivation, OCP-interpretation checks
whether the variable bearing this index c-commands the pro-variable
(irrespective of the syntactic relation the controller bears). Notice that this
can be done anyway, irrespective of the relative ordering of OCP-interpretation
and other rules.$ 

The formulation of a startverbpproprule3 might then be something like:

m1: BVERB{BVERBREC1}
m2: VAR{VARREC1}
m3: VAR{VARREC2}
m4: VAR{VARREC3}

m:  .....VERB{VERBREC1}......

GEN COND      ............
GEN ACTION    .............
              CASE BVERBREC1.controller OF
                 none  : VERBREC1.controller-index:=0;
                 first : VERBREC1.controller-index:=VARREC1.index;
                 second: VERBREC1.controller-index:=VARREC2.index;
                 third : VERBREC1.controller-index:=VARREC3.index;
              END {CASE-stmt} ;
              ..............


$ There is one problem for this approach: The value of the attribute 
controller-index is of type _integer_. As a consequence, in the surface parser
an infinite number of values must be 'tried' as a value for this attribute,
or, if the set of integers in real applications is finite, the number of 
ambiguities here is so vast (maxint for every verb), that no efficient parsing
can be done. For this reason it is necessary to set the value of this attribute
to one of a small, finite set of values (ideally, to exactly one value). This
can be done without any problems as far as I can see. The actual index can be
set to 0 if the same index appears somewhere else in the structure (that. so to
speak,  can function as an antecedent for the 'deleted' value) Therefore this
setting to 0 must be done in EMPTYsubstitutionrules, and in the rules for the
cases of control where there is an antecedent. See appendix B for an example of
such a setting to 0 in rules of control$
