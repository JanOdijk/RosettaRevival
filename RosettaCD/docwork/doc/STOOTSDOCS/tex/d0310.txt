\section{Introduction}
The English sentence grammar is divided in three parts, in the same way as all
other main category grammars. First, there is a subgrammar providing the 
PROP-structure, 
called {\bf VerbppropFormation}. Then, {\bf XPPROPtoCLAUSE} turns this prop
into a clause. Finally, {\bf ClauseToSentence} makes a full sentence of this
clause. Around the Sentence grammar there are two other, very small grammars.
Prior to VerbppropFormation, there is the {\bf VerbDerivation} grammar, and
following ClauseToSentence, there is the {\bf Utterance} grammar.

The current document describes the contents of 
the first Sentence subgrammar, Verbppropformation. The grammar consists of 
a number of rule classes and transformation classes. A rule class in its turn
consists of a number of rules and a transformation class of a number of 
transformations. The relative ordering of the rules and transformations in the
(sub)grammar is indicated by a {\em control expression}. A summary of these 
control expressions (i.e.\ a listing of the ordering of the rule classes, 
without explicit mentioning of the rules themselves) is also included here, 
and the initial (= head) and export categories are given. 

In the section on the rules and transformations, only the rule names 
are given here, but not the exact rule formulation. What is attempted 
is to provide a detailed overview of the workings of the (sub)grammars, and 
how the different rule classes achieve this,
together with some comments on the problems still to be solved, the reasons 
behind certain choices, and perhaps possible alternatives. For every rule, an 
example is given. If it is uncertain whether the example is correct (either 
because it may not be an example of the phenomenon in question, or because it 
may not be correct English), it is preceded by a question mark. Note that all 
explanation of rules and transformations is given from a generative viewpoint 
only, unless explicitly stated otherwise. Often, the information given in this 
document is based strongly on the comment already present in the documentation
of the rules themselves. Discrepancies between what is stated here and what is 
said in the rule itself are usually caused by the fact that the rule file has 
not been updated, although insights have changed.

Whenever the current implementation differs widely from the strategy that was 
devised in the definition phase of Rosetta3 (as laid down for English in docs.\ 
150, {\em Subgrammars of English\/}, 153, {\em Rule and Transformation Classes 
of English\/}, and 155, {\em Rule and Transformation Classes common to all 
languages\/}, all written by Jan Odijk), this will be indicated explicitly in 
the current document. Conditions on crucial orderings of rule classes will be 
repeated here, even if they do not differ from the original strategy, to make 
the document as self-contained as possible.

Finally note that the rules described in this document have NOT been tested 
properly. English analysis is not possible yet (there is no Surface Parser), 
and English generation has only been tested in as far the construction was the 
translation of a Dutch sentence to be tested.

\newpage
In principle, the authors of the rule classes have each documented their own 
classes: Andr\'{e} Schenk wrote the sections on TC\_IdiomCheck, 
RC\_IdStartVerbpRules and TC\_PossAdjSpelling, and Lisette Appelo wrote 
the sections on TC\_AktionsartCalc and RC\_TempAdvVar. The other sections have 
been written by Margreet Sanders.

\newpage
\section{Verbppropformation}
The task of this subgrammar is to provide a subverb with its correct number of 
argument variables, thus creating a prop-structure. Furthermore, variables for 
a number of non-argument adverbials and subordinate clauses are introduced 
here, and the structure is given a voice. Transformations take care of the 
realization of verbpatterns, particles, inherent reflexives and Aktionsart.

The general strategy for this subgrammar is the same as was mentioned in doc.\ 
150. A few changes have been made, however. They mainly concern the 
introduction of variables for non-argument adverbials. Instead of being all in 
one large class, the rules have been separated into different classes. This was 
mainly caused by a wish to keep the different cases separated until the 
ordering of the rule classes and their interrelation had 
been understood enough to incorporate the rules in one large class.
This stage has not been reached yet, nor is it certain that for English 
separation is not adequate. Note that English does not 
have any rules yet for instrumental adverbials, which also belong somewhere in 
these rule classes.

Another change in strategy concerning variables for adverbials is the way in 
which they are introduced. Doc.\ 155 announced an abstract preposition and an 
OPENPREPPPROP for temporal, locative and causative adverbials. This has now 
been changed to introduction of a simple PREPPVAR or ADVPVAR for all 
non-sentential variables introduced in this class. 
VP-modifying adverbials (including `agvpadvs'), which do require a PROP 
variable, have been removed from this rule class and are now placed in the next 
subgrammar, XPPROPtoCLAUSE.
More information on this 
subject can be found in the document on The Treatment of Adverbs in Rosetta3 
(by Jan Odijk, to appear).

The calculation of Aktionsart has been given its own transformation class, at 
the end of the subgrammar. In doc.\ 155 it was assumed that this could be done 
in the start rules.

Finally, it should be noted that no rules have been written yet for pre-VP 
modification. This rule class should come at the end of the subgrammar.

\section{Rules and Transformations}
\subsection{TC\_IdiomCheck}
\begin{description}
\item[Kind] Obligatory Transformation class
\item[Task] To determine whether the skey of the head (SUBVERB) is an idiom key 
or not. In case it is not, the ordinary startrules apply, in case it is, the
idiom start rules are called. These transformations are used because otherwise 
the `ordinary' startrules might be applied to an idiom verb, resulting in a 
crash in morhology because an idiom does not have a string directly connected 
with it. For more information, see doc.\ 273 on idioms.

\vspace{1 cm}
\begin{description}
\item[Name] TIsIdiom
\item[Task] To check whether the skey of the SUBVERB is an idiom key. If it is,
the special idiom startrules are called, and the ordinary startrules are 
skipped (see control expression).
\item[File] RC\_IdStartVerbpRules.mrule (mrules107.mrule)
\item[Semantics] --
\item[Example] lose (x1 lose\_x1's\_patience)
\item[Remarks]
\end{description}

\vspace{1 cm}
\begin{description}
\item[Name] TIsNotIdiom
\item[Task] To check whether the skey of the SUBVERB is not an idiom key. If it 
is not, the special idiom startrules are skipped, and the ordinary startrules 
can apply (see control expression).
\item[File] RC\_IdStartVerbpRules.mrule (mrules107.mrule)
\item[Semantics] --
\item[Example] lose (x1 lose x2)
\item[Remarks]
\end{description}

\vspace{1 cm}
\item[Remarks] This transformation class is new compared to doc.\ 150. 
\end{description}

\newpage
\subsection{RC\_StartVerbpRules}
\begin{description}
\item[Kind] Obligatory Rule class
\item[Task] To provide a (non-idiom) subverb with its correct number of 
argument variables and build a VERBP and VERBPPROP around it. There are rules
for ordinary verbs and rules for semi-idioms.
The import (i.e.\ the 
argument(s) the verb takes) to the former rules may be variables of any kind.
The import to the latter rules is subjected to an extra check.

The subverb is changed into a VERB, with all new attributes still at default 
value. It was decided to write rules 
for ergatives in English too, although it is not clear at all that they exist.
For testing purposes, a few verbs were entered into the dictionary as 
ergatives. Of course, the startrules needed for ergatives are the same 
as for raising verbs, so they will be needed anyway.

In English, no rules have been written for verbs with a deviant order of 
arguments (esp.\ vp132). In case the surface order of VP-arguments is different 
from the ordering in the startrules, a verbpattern is assigned which swaps 
them.
No theoretical considerations underly this decision; if it 
is thought better, new startrules may be written and current verbpattern rules 
may be replaced by others. If a thetavp like 210 will be used, the realization
cannot be taken care of by pattern rules anyway (the subject is not in the VP), 
and new startrules must be added.

\vspace{1 cm}
\begin{description}
\item[Name] RStartVPPROP000
\item[Task] To provide a prop structure for a verb that does not take any 
arguments at all (weather verbs). A dummy subject {\em It\/} is introduced 
here, of which it is not clear whether it is really non-referential. Perhaps it 
may even function as an antecedent for `reflexive weather verbs' like 
{\em It has rained itself out\/}. However, the reflexive spelling rules (see 
below) are not suited yet to deal with NP antecedents; they only work on 
variables.

\begin{description}
\item[Name] RStartVPPROP010a
\item[Task] To provide a prop structure for a verb that takes no subject, and 
one argument in the VERBP. This may be an ergative, or a raising verb. The verb 
is not a case assigner. No dummy subject is inserted, because the subject slot 
must remain empty to allow raising.

\vspace{1 cm}
\begin{description}
\item[Name] RStartVPPROP010b
\item[Task] To provide a prop structure for a verb that takes no subject, and
one argument in the VERBP, while the verb is a case assigner. In this case, a 
dummy subject is inserted to prevent the object from being raised. 
\item[File] RC\_StartVerbpRules.mrule (mrules50.mrule)

\begin{description}
\item[Name] RStartVPPROP123
\item[Task] To provide a prop structure for a verb that takes three arguments,
one a subject and the other two in the VERBP.
\item[File] RC\_StartVerbpRules.mrule (mrules50.mrule)
\item[Semantics]
\item[Example] give $\rightarrow$ x1 give x2 x3

\vspace{1 cm}
\begin{description}
\item[Name] RSIDStartVPPROP120
\item[Task] To provide a prop structure for a verb which is part of a semi 
idiom and which takes two arguments,
one a subject and the other in the VERBP. The head of the argument NP in VERBP 
is specified as being equal to the key the subverb expects for the semi-idiom.
\item[File] RC\_StartVerbpRules.mrule (mrules50.mrule)
\item[Semantics]
\item[Example] give $\rightarrow$ x1 give x2=shout
\item[Remarks]
\end{description}

\begin{description}
\item[Name] RSIDStartVPPROP123
\item[Task] To provide a prop structure for a verb which is part of a semi 
idiom and which takes three arguments,
one a subject and the other two in the VERBP. The head of the first (`object') 
argument NP in the VERBP is specified as being equal to the key the subverb 
expects for the semi-idiom.
\item[File] RC\_StartVerbpRules.mrule (mrules50.mrule)
\item[Semantics]
\item[Example] give $\rightarrow$ x1 give x2=demonstration x3
\item[Remarks]
\end{description}

\vspace{1 cm}
\item[Remarks] The calculation of the Aktionsart of the VERBPPROP is not done 
here, as was assumed in doc.\ 155, but in a separate transformation class 
coming at the end of the subgrammar. This is necessary since the calculation 
rules are quite complex and crucially need information on the kind of arguments
the verb takes, and not the just the number of arguments.

because they had not been thought of 
yet. For comment on the ordering of the two VP-arguments, see what was said in

\item[Remarks] No definition has been found yet for a sensible check on the 
possible patterns going with the prep introduced in this rule. For the moment,
it is assumed the prep takes more or less the same pattern as the verb, minus 
the prep itself.

One new verbpattern with a prep has been discovered until now:\\
x1 amount argrel/VAR $\rightarrow$ x1 amount [to (open-measurephrase)NPPROP)] \\
(His debts amount to over \$1,000)

\item[Remarks] In the current implementation, the verbpattern going with this 
rule is simply {\em synEMPTY\_PREPNP\/}. This is not enough, since there is an 
extra demand, viz.\ that there are two prepkeys for the verb (prepkey2 is the 
one that is realised). A sentence like {\em We asked EMPTY for a break\/} 
would also have to be made by the same pattern, and there is only one prepkey 
for the verb {\em ask\/}. Therefore, the example with {\em talk\/} given here 
will have to be renamed into something like {\em synEMPTY\_PREP2NP\/}, and the 
appropriate rule for the `one prep case' has to be added to the set of 
verbpatterns.

\subsection{RC\_SentAdvVar}

\begin{description}
\item[Kind] Iterative Rule class
\item[Task] To introduce a variable for adverbial subordinate sentences in 
different positions and sentence or causal adverbials in 
initial position. The conjunction may also be a preposition. No rules have 
been written yet for abstract conjunctions. 

The rules are in an iterative rule class, but have been written in such a way 
that only one order of application is possible. This to prevent unnecessary 
ambiguities in analysis.

be included.
\end{description}

\newpage
\subsection{RC\_VoiceRules}

\begin{description}
\item[Kind] Obligatory Rule Class
\item[Task] To give active or passive voice to the prop-structure, and to 
change the subject in a by-object and the verb into a participle 
in case of a passive. The rules make use of a 
parameter, {\em voicepar\/}, so that a certain voice in one language is mapped 
onto both voices 
in another language with the original voice in the parameter. Then the 
restriction holds that the rule with the `different' voice may apply only if 
the rule with the same voice is impossible in the target language. E.g.\ when 
a Dutch 
sentence has an active voice, in English both voice rules are called, with the 
parameter `active'. The passive rule (with parameter `active') may apply only 
if the verb in question does not have an active form. This is explained in more 
detail in doc.\ 315, {\em Voice in Dutch\/}, by Jan Odijk.

\vspace{1 cm}
\begin{description}
\item[Name] RActive
\item[Task] To put a sentence in active voice, either because the original 
sentence was active (in analysis and in generation; voice parameter = active)
or because the English verb used in the translation cannot form a passive 
(in generation only; voice parameter = passive)
\item[File] RC\_VoiceRules.mrule (mrules43.mrule)
\item[Semantics]
\item[Example] x1 sing x2 $\rightarrow$ x1 sing x2 (John sang an aria)
\item[Remarks]
\end{description}

\vspace{1 cm}
\begin{description}
\item[Name] RPassive1
\item[Task] To put a sentence in passive voice, either because the original 
sentence was passive (in analysis and in generation; voice parameter = passive)
or because the English verb used in the translation cannot form an active
(in generation only; voice parameter = active). The subject of the sentence, 
which is an NP/CNVAR or an EMPTYVAR, is put in a by-object. The first verb is 
changed into a participle. The auxiliary of the passive will be introduced 
later (in the clause-formation rules).
\item[File] RC\_VoiceRules.mrule (mrules43.mrule)
\item[Semantics]
\item[Example] x1 sing x2 $\rightarrow$ sung x2 by x1 (The aria was sung by John)
\item[Remarks]
\end{description}

\vspace{1 cm}
\begin{description}
\item[Name] RPassive2
\item[Task] To put a sentence in passive voice, either because the original 
sentence was passive (in analysis and in generation; voice parameter = passive)
or because the English verb used in the translation cannot form an active
(in generation only; voice parameter = active). The subject of the sentence, 
which is a wh or yesno SENTENCEVAR, is put in a by-object. The first verb is 
changed into a participle. The auxiliary of the passive will be introduced 
later (in the clause-formation rules).
\item[File] RC\_VoiceRules.mrule (mrules43.mrule)
\item[Semantics]
\item[Example] ? x1 puzzle x2 $\rightarrow$ puzzled x2 by x1 (I was 
puzzled by what to do next; unless this is incorrect English: Longman gives `I 
was puzzled (about) what to do next')
\item[Remarks] Perhaps this rule is not needed: all examples found are either 
doubtful English or may well be simple NPs, like `I was surprised by what you 
told me'.
\end{description}

\vspace{1 cm}
\item[Remarks] \mbox{}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item The voice rules are ordered crucially before TC\_ReflexiveSpelling and 
TC\_PossAdjSpelling, because those transformation classes need a subject as 
antecedent. In case of a passive structure, the subject has been moved to a by-
phrase, and hence reflexives or other subject-bound anaphora cannot occur.
  \item No rules have been written to account for middle voice ({\em This book 
sells well\/}). Analysis of the middle voice construction is not conclusive 
enough to implement any well-defined strategy.
  \end{itemize}
\end{description}

\newpage
\subsection{TC\_ReflexiveSpelling}

\begin{description}
\item[Kind] Obligatory Transformation Class
\item[Task] To spell out the reflexive pronoun for verbs that are inherently 
reflexive. It is assumed that all reflexives in English take the subject of the 
verb as antecedent (cf.\ Dutch, were {\em zich voordoen\/} is considered an 
ergative, and hence takes the object as antecedent). The number, person and 
gender of the subject determine the actual form of the reflexive. Note what was 
said in RStartVPPROP000: the rules only deal with VAR subjects.

Also, it is assumed that 
English does not have any inherently reciprocal reflexives. Perhaps the 
attribute 
value {\bf reciprocal} may still be used in English, to indicate that a verb
may delete the `reciprocal' argument: {\em They met each other $\rightarrow$ 
they met\/} (again cf.\ Dutch, 
where the verb {\em ontmoeten\/} takes an obligatory reciprocal if no other 
argument is specified: {\em Zij ontmoetten elkaar\/}). Note that argument 
reflexives and reciprocals are not covered by 
this rule class. They are dealt with in TC\_ArgReflSpelling and 
RC\_ReciprocalSpelling, which are in the next subgrammar.

In English, a difference is made between direct object reflexives (the usual 
case) and indirect object reflexives. Usually, the reflexive is put in direct 
object position, but indirect object reflexives receive an indobjrel
(only example so far: {\em have\/}: they had themselves a ball).

divided into two parts, one for reflexives, and one for idiom possessives (see 
below)
  \item This transformation class is ordered crucially after the voice rules. 
Reflexives are allowed only if there still is a subject, so passive structures 
cannot have a reflexive. Also, the transformations must be ordered before 
object-to-subject raising.

possessives.
  \item This transformation class is ordered crucially after the voice rules. 
Idiomatic PossAdjs are allowed only if there still is a subject, so passive 
structures 
cannot have a PossAdj. Also, the transformation must be ordered before 
object-to-subject raising.

\vspace{1 cm}
\item[Remark] In doc.\ 155, it was assumed that Aktionsart calculation could be 
done in the Startrules. However, the rules are complex, and crucially need 
information about the kind of arguments the verb takes, not just about their 
number. Therefore, the calculation had to be postponed to at least after the 
pattern rules and the introduction of reflexives. More information on the 
subject can be found in docs.\ 53, {\em Translation of Temporal Expressions in 
Rosetta3\/}, and 263, {\em Documentation on the rules for the translation of 
temporal expressions in Rosetta3, part I\/}, both by Lisette Appelo.
