Preface

$ In ROSETTA, morphology deals with inflection and derivation. For the time
being, compounding will be ignored. In this document, we will give an impression
of what is done for Dutch inflection.$
$ A separate document gives all affix-rules and lextree-rules for inflection.
Due to recent discussion, there is an inconsistency between this document 
and the document with rules; see section 8.$
$NP
$CH 1,Introduction
$ This document consists of several parts, which are:$
- domain T for Dutch (section 2),
- general explanation of the rules for segmentation, the GLUE-rules and the 
  LEXTREE-rules (section 3),
- explanation of the way verbs are dealt with in Dutch morphology (section 4),
- idem, for nouns (section 5),
- idem, for adjectives and adverbs (section 6),
- idem, for the remaining categories (section 7),
- a section with 'future remarks'; here some possible future changes in the 
  rules are discussed (section 8).

$CH 2,Domain T of Dutch morphology
$ This section contains domain T of the Dutch morphology as far as it is
relevant for inflection: all categories and category-records, that are used
in inflection, are specified here. Also, the attributes (together with the 
possible attribute-values) and the suffix- and prefix-keys are listed here.$

$CH 3,Rules
$ In the Dutch morphological component of ROSETTA3 the following rules are 
used: $
- GLUE rules, for contractions of several kinds (see section 3.1),
- segmentation rules, that combine (in generation) or split (in analysis)
  stem and suffixes (see section 3.2),
- phonological rules, that act as condition on segmentation (see section 3.3),
- lextree rules, that -analytically speaking- build S-trees out of a word and
  a suffix (see section 3.4).
$ In the following sections, the way these rules work will be illustrated.$
$CH 3.1,GLUE rules
$ In analysis, GLUE rules split words; the parts (which are _strings_) are bound
by a "GLUE":$
    erheen     --> er  + GLUE + heen
    losgemaakt --> los + GLUE + gemaakt
$ In generation, words bound by a GLUE are sticked together:$
    er  + GLUE + heen    --> erheen
    los + GLUE + gemaakt --> losgemaakt
$ For Dutch, GLUE rules are used for the following phenomenons:$
- contraction of the words "er", "daar", "hier", "ergens", "nergens", "overal"
  and "waar" with prepositions or adverbs ("ertoe", "daarheen", ...),
- contraction of particle and verb (see also section 4.5),
- contraction of "van" and "de" to: "der".
$ The GLUE rules are listed in a separate document.$
$CH 3.2,Segmentation rules
$CH 3.2.1,About the rules
$ Segmentation rules split -analytically speaking- a word into a stem and a 
prefix or suffix. The stem is a _string_, the prefix or suffix is represented
as a _key_. Examples:$
    *oo         + SFKt       :: *oot;         {(hij) shampoo_t_}
    *giet       + SFKovtvd1  :: *goot;        {(hij) _goot_, (hij) be_goot_}
    PFKge       + ij*        :: geij*;        {_ge_ijld}
    ik          + SFKsgdat   :: mij;          {_mij_}
$ ('*' stands for arbitrary strings)$
$ As we see here, segmentation rules are used for 'real' suffixes ("-t" for
3rd person singular in present) and prefixes ("ge-" for past participles),
but also for ablaut (=change of stem vowel), like "giet"-->"goot", and even
for the change of complete strings, as in the last example.$
$ In general, segmentation rules always handle one suffix or prefix at a time;
often we need more than one segmentation rule to 'make' a word, which is
illustrated by the following example:$
    help        + SFKvd1     :: holp;        {ablaut}
    holp        + SFKen      :: holpen;      {"-en" suffix}
    PFKge       + holpen     :: geholpen;    {"ge-" prefix}
$ This means that the set of segmentation rules must be called recursively.
Some rules however, especially the ones that do _not_ result in a lenghtening
of the string (as in the above given rules for ablaut), cannot be applied
recursively because of danger of 'looping' during execution. Therefore, the
set of segmentation rules is split into two subsets: one that can be called
recursively, and one that can be called once. In generation, the set that can
be called once, will be called _before_ the other set (which then can be called
as often as needed); this means that during the generation of a word only one 
of the non-recursive segmentation rules can be applied, _and_ that this rule 
always is the first one (so, ablaut can only work on stems, and an 'ablauted' 
form can never get ablaut again in this approach). As the rules show, this 
strict order is sufficient for the segmentation of any Dutch word.$
$ The _freefix rules_ form -in fact- 
an extra set of non-recursive suffix-rules, but
freefix rules differ from suffix rules because they more restricted: in freefix
rules, the input and output strings must be specified fully (the '*' is not
allowed). The freefix rules are -in generation- applied before the non-recursive
suffix rules; in Dutch they are used for pronouns.$
$ The prefix rules are -like the suffix rules- split into two subsets: one set
of rules that can be applied recursively, and one that be called only once.
All prefix rules for inflection are in the first set.$
$ More information about the segmentation rules can be found in the document
where the prefix, freefix and suffix rules are listed.$
$CH 3.2.2,Data
$ A large amount of data underlies the segmentation rules. Often, the stem and
the string belonging to the affix interact (think of: consonant doubling,
change or ommission of letters, etc.). Several sources have been used
to collect the relevant data: ANS, the tape of Van Dale N-N, the 'grammaticaal
compendium' of Van Dale, reverse dictionaries for Dutch (Nieuwborg, Martin),
"Praktische Cursus Spelling" (Klein & Visscher). Of course, data influenced
many choices about attributes and their values.$
$ The segmentation rules are listed in a separate document; in the general, 
the rules will be self-explanatory (besides, all segmentation rules are followed
by examples that will help to understand).$
$CH 3.3,Phonological Rules
$CH 3.3.1,pronunciation-attributes
$ In the Dutch morphology, two pronunciation-attributes are used:
"sjwa" en "wissel", both with the values "true" and "false".$
$ The attribute "sjwa" is "true" when the last syllable of the word contains
a sjwa. In Dutch, this can only be the case when "e", "i" or "ij" is written
(all of these letters also have other pronunciations, and in that case 
"sjwa" is "false" of course). Example: "schot_e_l"(sjwa=true) (compare: 
"hot_e_l" with sjwa=false). Other examples: dikk_e_, dikk_e_rd, monn_i_k, 
verrukkel_ij_k, hand_e_l, etc. The attribute "sjwa" is "false" in all other
cases (and also in: "race", "bridge").$
$ The attribute "wissel" is "true" when the last letter of the word is a "s"
or "f" but only if these can change into "z" resp. "v" during inflection. 
Examples: "doo_f_", that can change into "do_v_e", "doos", that can change into
"do_z_en", etc. the value of "wissel" is "false" in all other cases.$
$ The attribute "wissel" differs from the attribute "sjwa", because it is not
directly connected to pronunciation: the "s" and "f" in words with +wissel and 
in words with -wissel are pronounced equally. But, a relation exists between
pronunciation and the attribute "wissel:
In Dutch, voiced consonants at the end of words become voiceless, and 
often the spelling doesn't follow this rule. This holds for "b",
that is pronounced as "p" at the end of a word (i.e.: "web"), and "d", that
is pronounced as "t" at the end of a word (i.e.: "dood"). For "v" and "z"
both pronunciation and spelling change: "reizen"->"reis", "roven"->"roof".
The ROSETTA system only deals with _written_ sentences, so no
problems arise when ambiguities in pronunciation are encountered, as long as 
there is difference in spelling: "lood" - "loot";"krab" - "krap". Therefore, no 
measures are needed for words ending in "b" or "d".
Problems do arise for "v" and "z", because here the written forms are equal 
too: the stem "golf" is ambiguous between the verbs "golven" and "golfen". Here,
special measures have to be taken, which is done by introducing the 
attribute "wissel".$
$CH 3.3.2,Check on pronunciation
$ In some cases, it is important to have a check on pronunciation when words
undergo inflection; we 
need it, for example, to distinguish between "`bedelen" and "be`delen"
(the same holds for: `beteren vs. be`teren, and: `legeren vs. le`geren), and
to prevent that the plural form of the stem "wandel" will be written as
"wandellen" instead of "wandelen", etc.$
$ Sometimes however, the check on pronunciation is not needed for the spelling
of words; it doesn't make any difference, for example, whether or not the "ij"
is pronounced as sjwa, because this doesn't cause variation in spelling.$
$ In the following situations +sjwa and -sjwa words are spelled different 
(examples of verbs both with +sjwa and with -sjwa are given):$
*<consonant>el   {wandel  vs. bel }
*<consonant>em   {adem    vs. rem }
*<consonant>en   {teken   vs. ren }
*<consonant>er   {vorder  vs. sper}
*<consonant>es   {hannes  vs. fles} 
*<consonant>ig   {stenig  vs. lig }
*<consonant>ik   {hinnik  vs. stik}
*<consonant>et   {lemmet  vs. smet (only for nouns)}
*<consonant>it   {kievit  vs. pit  (only for nouns)}
$ In these cases, different rules for +sjwa and -sjwa words _must_ be made.$
$ In other cases, it is _not_ relevant for spelling whether "e" or "i" is 
pronounced as sjwa. Example (where the "e" is not preceded by a vowel): 
the stemverbs "lui_e_r"(+sjwa) and "kier"(-sjwa)
both get identically formed present plural forms (with simply "en" sticked 
to the stem. In these cases, different suffix rules for +sjwa and -sjwa words
are possible, but _not_ necessary.$
$ The attribute "wissel" is almost always relevant; nearly _every_ word ending 
in "f" or "s" can meet rules where differences in spelling occur when it 
undergoes inflection.$
$CH 3.3.3,List of phonological rules
$ In this section, we will specify all phonological rules of the Dutch ROSETTA 
morphology.$
$ Actually, every segmentation-rule that deals with suffixes is accompanied by
a phonological rule. The 'default'-rule "FONleegleeg" however, is never
written. Every rule consists of a condition and an action; in the condition
the values of the attributes "sjwa" and "wissel" can be tested, in the action
new values can be assigned. Attributes keep their original value when no new
value is assigned to them in the action.$
$ In theory, many combinations attribute-value pairs are possible in both 
condition and action. In practice, the number of rules is limited. One important
reduction results from the fact that the combination of +sjwa and +wissel does 
_not_ exist in Dutch words (at least no word with this combination could be 
found); therefore, the 'sjwa:=true' assignment can always be made together with
the 'wissel:=false' assignment (and the other way around).$

The rules are:

FONleegleeg
C: true
A: @
{ this 'default-rule' is never written; the condition is always true, the action
  doesn't change anything }

FONleegsjwa            { example: verg-vergen }
C: true
A: fonuit.sjwa:=true
   fonuit.wissel:=false

FONleegonwissel        { lees-leest, leef-[ge]leefd }

A: fonuit.wissel:=true
   fonuit.sjwa:=false
$CH 3.4,Lextree rules
$ Lextree rules build lexical S-trees out of a word and one or more derivational
or inflectional affixes. In the morphology of ROSETTA, we have three types of
categories for the main categories: BCAT (BVERB, BNOUN, BADJ, BADV), SUBCAT 
(SUBVERB, SUBNOUN, etc.) and CAT (VERB, NOUN, etc.). The first type is in the 
dictionary, the second type is made out of the first by combining the word
with one or more derivational affixes (like: "ex-" or "-baar"), and the third is
made out of the second by applying inflection.$
$ The lextree rules for derivation produce trees like:$
$RL 8
                             SUBCAT
                               /\
                              /  \
                       BPREFIX    SUBCAT
                                    /\
                                   /  \
                               BCAT    BSUFFIX
$NL 1
$ There may be several levels with SUBCAT nodes and the derivational affixes 
will be represented as nodes.$
$ The lextree rules for inflection make a CAT out of a SUBCAT:$
$RL 5
                                CAT {....}
                                 |
                                 |
                              SUBCAT
$NL 1
$ Inflectional suffixes are not represented as nodes in the S-tree; the
information about the inflectional form is represented by means of 
attribute-values.$
$ Lextree rules are condition-action pairs; the action will be done only
if the condition is true. Each rule consists of two of these pairs: one
for analysis and one for generation. The condition-action pair is called 
'comp' for analysis and 'decomp' for generation.$
$ In Dutch, we have five types of rules:$
     - rules that make a SUBCAT out of a BCAT;
     - rules that make a SUBCAT out of a SUBCAT;
     - rules that make a CAT out of a SUBCAT;
     - rules that make a CAT out of a BCAT;
     - rules that make a CAT out of a CAT.
$ The first two types are derivational rules; the last three are inflectional
rules, and will be illustrated here.$
$ In principle, the inflectional lextree rules for Dutch build words at one
go. There is, for instance, a rule that builds the past participle "gelopen" 
out of the stem "loop", and another rule that builds the infinitive "lopen"
out of "loop", and both rules are independent (an alternative would be 
to use the rule for "lopen" as input for the rule for "gelopen").
This principle has an important advantage: lextree rules always take 
single stems or stems 
with derivational affixes as input, and never 'obscure' (partially inflected) 
forms (such an obscure form would be: "wroken", which is neither a stem of 
a Dutch word, nor is it a Dutch word in itself, but
could be an intermediate form between the stem "wreek" and the past participle
"gewroken"). The disadvantages are: often rules overlap, and in some cases,
rules will be rather complex.$
$ Two rules do not obey this 'at-one-go'-principle; by making two 
'CAT-to-CAT'-rules, the number of rules 'SUBCAT-to-CAT'-rules could be
reduced considerable. One of these two rules sticks "-e" or "-en" to things of 
the category VERB, in the following situation:$
     - past participle + "-e"              (gevraagd-gevraagde)
     - past participle + "-en"             (gevraagd-gevraagden)
     - present participle + "-e"           (vragend-vragende)
     - present participle + "-en"          (vragend-vragenden)
$ The other sticks "-e" or "-en" to things of the category ADJ, in case of:$
     - adjectives in positive + "-e"       (groot-grote)
     - adjectives in positive + "-en"      (groot-groten)
     - adjectives in comparative + "-e"    (groter-grotere)
     - adjectives in comparative + "-en"   (groter-groteren)
     - adjectives in superlative + "-e"    (grootst-grootste)
     - adjectives in superlative + "-en"   (grootst-grootsten)
     - adjectives in allersuperl.+ "-e"    (allergrootst-allergrootste)
     - adjectives in allersuperl.+ "-en"   (allergrootst-allergrootsten)
$ Note that in these rules:$
- the input is always something that is a word of Dutch already (which means 
  that the input is never 'obscure'),
- often, the resulting word functions, in some sense, like a word of another
  category ("gevraagde", for instance, functions as adjective; "grote"
  in some sense functions like a noun).
$ Only one attribute changes its value in these 'CAT->CAT'-rules: 'eORenForm' 
will change from 'NoForm' to 'eForm' or 'enForm'
(see sections 4.4, 6.3, and 6.6). When these phenomena would 
be handled 
in rules according to the 'at-one-go'-principle, the number of rules would 
be nearby doubled.$
$ One should note that _other_ inflectional phenomena with the "-e"-suffix,
like the present tense of the conjunctive in Dutch ("men nem_e_", "lev_e_ de 
koningin", etc.) are handled in lextree rules of the type 'SUBCAT changes into
CAT'. The same holds for other inflectional phenomena with the "-en"-suffix.$

$CH 4,Verbs
$CH 4.1,Conjugationclasses
In Dutch, we can distinguish the following verb types:
- verbs with limited inflection,
- weak verbs,
- strong verbs,
- irregular verbs.
$ As we will see, the set of verbs of three of these four types can 
be subdivided 
into groups of verbs, that have resemblant conjugation. These groups are
the "conjugationclasses" of the Dutch morphology for ROSETTA.
In the next sections we will discuss each of these types, and the 
conjugationclasses corresponding to them. The inherent attribute "conjclasses"
gives the conjugationclass(es) of each verb in ROSETTA.$
$CH 4.1.1,Verbs with limited inflection
$ This verb type corresponds to one conjugationclass, namely class 0. All
verbs belonging to this conjugationclass are limited in their inflection;
the only possible forms are: infinitive and present participle. The other
forms are ungrammatical. Example: "buikspreken", which
has the following wellformed forms: "buikspreken"(inf.),  "buiksprekend(e)" 
(pres. part.). Other forms, as: "sprak buik" or "buikspreekte"
(past sing.), are judged ungrammatical by (most) speakers of Dutch.
Other examples: "zweefvliegen", "kunstrijden", "wielrijden", "langlaufen", etc.$
$ The existing inflected forms of the verbs of class 0 can easily be obtained 
by using the same lextree rules as for weak verbs; therefore, the lextree 
rules for infinitive and present participle of weak verbs also work for verbs 
of conjugationclass 0.$
$CH 4.1.2,Weak verbs
$ The weak verbs correspond to two conjugationclasses, namely class 3 and
class 4. Class 3 verbs form their past participle with the "ge"-prefix, class 4
verbs, in contrary, do without.$
In the present tense, all verbs get regular endings: 
- no ending for the first person singular ("ik werk"), and the second person 
  singular when in reverse order: "werk jij";
- "-t" for the second person singular (but not in reverse order) and the third
  person singular, but not when the stem ends in "t" already (in that case 
  there is no ending ("hij werkt", "hij plant" (vs. *"hij plantt"));
- "-en" for the plural forms of the first, second and third person (wij/jullie/
  zij "werken"); and "-t" for the fourth and the fifth person (u/gij werkt).
$ Both in the past tense and in past participle
forms, two different suffixes exist in Dutch: "-de" and "-te" for past forms,
"-d" and "-t" for the past participle. The "-de" and "-d" forms are used 
adjacent to the following vowels and (voiced) consonants: a, b, d, dge 
("bridge"), ee, ie, oe, ue, f, g, i, ij, l, m, n, o, r, s, u, w, y; the "-te" 
and "-t" form are used when the stem ends in: ce ("race"), ch, f, k, p, s, sh, 
sj, t, x.$ 
$ When the stem of a verb ends in "f" or "s", which are included in both groups,
"-de"/"-d" is chosen when "f" changes into "v" or "s" into "z" in the 
inflectional process (for instance in the infinitive form: "roof"-"roven" 
and "-te"/"-t" is chosen when "f" and "s" never change in 
inflection ("ruis"-"ruisen"). Verbs with change of "f" and
"s" are marked by a phonological attribute.
Some verbs ending in "f" and "s" have both suffixes: "sponsde", "sponste"
(In fact, there are two infinitives: "sponzen" and "sponsen").
Sometimes, verbs with the same stem form have different
suffixes: the "f" in "golf" changes when the verb means "to wave", in the verb
"golf" with the meaning "to play golf", however, it doesn't change.$
$ The past participle doesn't get a suffix when the stem already ends in 't'
or 'd' ("plant"-"geplant", "dood"-"gedood").$
$ The plural form of the past tense get the regular plural ending "-(e)n" extra
for the first, second and third person; all 
other forms (infinitive, imperative, etc.) have regular inflection too.$
$CH 4.1.3,Strong verbs
$ Verbs of this type have _ablaut_ (change of vowel) in the past tense and/or
past participle forms; they can belong to several conjugationclasses:$

5       ablaut in past tense; past participle with "-en" ending and "ge-"-
        prefix;
        (dragen-droeg-gedragen, blazen-blies-geblazen)
6       as class 5, but past participle without "ge-"; 
        (verdragen-verdroeg-verdragen)

7       (same) ablaut in past tense and past participle; past participle with 
        "-en"-ending and "ge-"-prefix;
        (blinken-blonk-geblonken)
8       as class 7, but past participle without "ge-"; 
        (verbinden-verbond-verbonden)

9       (same) ablaut in past tense and past participle; past participle with 
        regular ending and "ge-"-prefix;
        (denken-dacht-gedacht)
10      idem, but past participle without  "ge-";
        (verdenken-verdacht-verdacht)

11      ablaut in past tense, and (a different) ablaut  in past participle;
        past participle with "-en" ending. 
        (bevelen-beval-bevolen, bidden-bad-gebeden)
12      idem, but past participle without "ge-". 
        (verbreken-verbrak-verbroken)

13      ablaut in past tense; past participle doesn't exists.
        Often, verbs of this class have also a (full) weak conjugation,
        and therefore belong to class 3 too. 
        (durven-dorst (reg.:durven-durfde-gedurfd), plegen-placht (no reg.))

15      verbs with a regular past tense, and past participle with ablaut and  
        "-en" ending. 
        Actually, some of these verbs have a past participle that does
        not have ablaut (but do have "-en" ending); of course these verbs
        could have formed a separate class, but for convenience they are 
        combined with the other verbs of this class; as a consequence of this
        incorporation, we now have segmentation rules of the type:
            *bak + SFKvd2 :: *bak; ,
        where the string at the left is identical with the one at the right.
        Of course, no recursion should be applied here.
        (bakken-bakte-gebakken, wreken-wreekte-gewroken)
16      idem, but past participle without "ge-". 
        (vermalen-vermaalde-vermalen)

Note: conjugationclass 14 doesn't exist.
        
$ All strong verbs have regular conjugation for the present tense. Also,
they have regular infinitive, imperative and present participle forms.
Actually, the only way these verbs differ from the weak ones, is that they
have ablaut instead of the regular ending for the past form and/or ablaut 
(often combined with "-en" ending) for the past participle, again instead of
the regular ending. As we have seen, some strong verbs even have weak
past forms (class 15,16). Because of this rather great similarity between
strong and weak verbs, it is possible to write one set of 
lextree rules for both. This in contrary to the irregular verbs, 
that have their own set of lextree rules.$
$  A separate list of strong verbs will not be given in this section;
as a matter of fact, the segmentation rules give such a list, but one should
note that several verbs are not listed there while they would cause redundant 
paths. The verb "bezwijken", for instance, is _not_ listed, because of the rule
for "*wijken" ('*' denotes 'variabel string'(the empty string included)). Also,
the rule for "*wijken" works for "afwijken". Most 'simple' strong verbs can 
get prefixes as: 'her', 'ver', 're', etc., and therefore every rule has a '*'.$
$ The number of segmentation rules could have been limited by combining verbs
with identical ablaut (and stem ending): the rules for "*wijken" and "*kijken"
could have been joined in a single rule for "*ijken", because both end in 'k' 
and have 'ij'->'ee' ablaut, but for reasons of readibility we have decided not 
to do so. Now, every segmentation rule for ablaut has as its left hand member
a (minimal) verbstem, preceded by '*'.$
$ A complete list of 'simple' verbs that are not listed because their stem
contains another 'simple' verb with identical ablaut:$
      bezwijken     (see: wijken)
      braden        (see: raden, class 15)
      blijken       (see: lijken)
      glijden       (see: lijden)
      knijpen       (see: nijpen)
      krijgen       (see: rijgen)

      stijgen       (see: tijgen, class 7)
      strijden      (see: rijden)
      vliegen       (see: liegen)
      zwerven       (see: werven)
$ The rules for "*krijs" and "*rijs" (class 7) are a special case: they do 
not overlap, because they are restricted by different phonological conditions.$

Note:
$ Irregular verbs can have extra past forms, but do not always have
more conjugationsclasses (extra forms can be added easily for irregular
verbs). Example: "willen" with: "wou" and "wilde" (class 1).$
$ The verb "varen" has a second OVT-form ("vaarde") when it is not used in its
simple form. Compare with: "gelachen" versus: "geglimlacht", "gegrimlacht", 
etc.$ 
$ Also there seems to be difference in meaning between "zegde" en "zei";
"zegde" is always used in compound verbs or verbs combined with particles,
whereas the use of "zei" is limited to the simple verb "zeggen". Compare:
"toezeggen", "afzeggen", ... vs. "zeggen".$ 
$ The form "vraagde" will presumably not be correct for every native 
speaker of Dutch.$
$CH 4.2,tense and mood (the attribute 'tijd')
$ Dutch verb forms have tense and mood. In the Dutch morphology of 
ROSETTA, both 
are expressed by one attribute: 'tijd'. Values of this attribute:
ott (present), ovt (past), vd (past participle), td (present participle),
gb (imperative), inf (infinitive), conjunctiefott (conjunctive present) and
conjunctiefovt (conjunctive past).$
$CH 4.3,Number and persons 
$ The attribute 'number' in ROSETTA has three values: 
plural, singular and omeganumber.$
$ The following 'persons' exist in Dutch morphology of ROSETTA: $
$NL 1
$RL 8
singular:
   0   - second person singular in present (but only in cases of reverse order),
   1   - first person singular
   2   - second person singular
   3   - third person singular
   4   - "u"-form singular
   5   - "gij"-form singular
   6   - "men"-form (always equal to the third person singular)
$NL 1
$RL 6
plural:
   1   - first person plural
   2   - second person plural
   3   - third person plural
   4   - "u"-form plural
   5   - "gij"-form plural
$NL 1
$ The attribute 'persons' may contain a _set_ of the above given values.$
$CH 4.4,eORenForm
$ The attribute 'eORenForm' has three values: 'NoForm', 'eForm' and 'enForm'.
The values 'eForm' and 'enForm' appear only in case of past participles and 
present participles. For instance: "gevraagde" and "slapende" have the value 
'eForm', "gevraagden" and "slapenden" have the value 'enForm'.$
$ The morphology only makes the forms: in case of the value 'eForm' it
adds "e", and in case of 'enForm' it adds "en". In case of 'NoForm', nothing is
added. The decision, whether or not "e" or "en" should be added, is beyond the
reach of morphology because it depends on the context of a word (like: the 
preceding article, etc.). Therefore, the M-grammar must yield the value of
'eORenForm'. For verbs, the conjugationclass is of importance, because
irregularities appear when the past participle (if used as adjective)
ends in "-en" instead of "-d" or "-t". 
Compare: "de gesteld_e_ vraag", "het bedacht_e_ verhaal", and:
"de verzonnen kwestie". The following conjugationclasses have a past participle
ending in "-en": 5, 6, 7, 8, 11, 12, 15, 16. The conjugationclasses 3, 4, 9 
and 10 have
past participles ending in "-d" or "-t". The conjugationclasses 1 and 2 
(=irregular verbs) have _both_ past participles ending in "-d"/"-t" _and_ 
past particles ending in "-en"
(and also in "-aan": "gegaan", "gestaan" and "gedaan", which do get "-e", like
those ending in "-d" and "-t"); here, we need to
enumerate the _keys_ of verbs that do have past participle ending in "-en" 
(the best choice to do this will probably be enumeration of the complement of
this set, the verbs that _don't_ have a past participle ending in "-en", 
because this is a smaller set). Verbs of conjugationclass 0 and 13 don't 
have a past participle, and therefore no problems will arise here.$
$ No problems arise when "-en" is added to past participles, or when
"-e" or "-en" is added to present participles.$
$ Note that there is a difference between past participles acting as a
'normal' adjective and (some of) those acting as a nominalised form:$
      De gekrompen kledingstukken worden weggegooid.
      Zie je die broeken? Zoek de gekrompen er maar uit.
      Al het gekrompen_e_ dient uitgezocht te worden.
      De bedrogen man kwam klagen.
      De bedrogen_e_ kwam klagen.
$CH 4.5,verbs with particles
$ A lot of verbs are accompanied by a particle; examples are:
"losmaken", "doodgaan", "weglopen", etc. The number of particles is limited;
the number of verbs that they can accompany, however, is not. In some 
inflectional forms, the particle is sticked to the verb, in others it is loose. 
Inflectional prefixes always precede the verb without particle: it's
"los_ge_maakt" instead of "_ge_losmaakt" (compare: "_ge_radbraakt", where
"rad" is _not_ a particle, but an inseparable part of the verb).$
$ In ROSETTA, the relation between particle and verb is made explicit by
means of a 'GLUE'-marker. Thus, all possible particles will be listed in the
so called 'glue rules' (see document on rules).$
$ It is quite difficult to get a complete list of particles for Dutch; grammars
always give the most frequent one's only. By using the N-N tape of 'Van Dale', 
it was possible to make a list of verbs, of which the -in the dictionary 
mentioned- past 
participle didn't begin with the inflectional prefix 'ge'. From this set, we 
could derive a rather large set of particles. Of some verbs, however, the
past participle is not mentioned in 'Van Dale'(although a lot of these verbs do 
have a complete inflection), so it's possible that we missed some particles.
A particle that was not found by using the tape was: "les": the entry "lesgeven"
didn't show the past participle form "lesgegeven". Of course, the set of verbs
that is given by dictionaries like 'Van Dale' is arbitrary to a certain extent: 
the word "theedrinken" is included, but "koffiedrinken" is _not_.$
$NP
$CH 5,Nouns
$CH 5.1,Plural forms
$ The normal plural endings in Dutch are the suffixes "-s" and "-(e)n"; the 
majority of Dutch nouns takes one of these two suffixes (and some nouns take
both, like: "appel"). Other endings also exist: "-eren" ("kinderen"), "-ien"
("koeien", "vlooien"), etc.$
$ Some nouns lack a plural form (like: "heelal", "verdriet"), and others are

rad-raderen, rund-runderen, volk-volkeren. "Vederen" might be the plural of 
"veer", but it is also possible that "vederen" is the plural of "veder" only,
and that "veren" is the (only) plural of "veer".$
$ Group 10: vlo-vlooien, koe-koeien.$
$ Group 11: la-laden, roe-roeden, ree-reden, stee-steden, tree-treden.$

roede-roeden, rede-reden, stede-steden, trede-treden.
The members of group 12 have other plural forms too: regio-regio's/regiones,
lende-lenden, rede-redes.$
$ Group 13 consists of nouns ending in the _stressed_ syllable "-ie": 
knie-kniee¨"n, antipathie-antipathiee¨"n; also compounds with this kind 
of nouns as the rightmost part belong to this group: 
voetbal_knie_-voetbal_kniee¨"n_, etc. 
The members of this group differ from the nouns ending in "-ie" without stress,
which have regular "-en"-ending: kolonie-kolonie¨"n, 
referentie-referentie¨"n, etc.
Another difference is formed by the fact that nouns of group 13 never have 
"sPlural", in contrast with nouns ending in stressless "-ie", that normally 
have "sPlural" too: *knies, *antipathies, but: kolonies, referenties. 
A third group of nouns ending in "-ie" is formed by words like "fraaie", 
"mooie", etc. These words have a sjwa (the 'e'), and therefore, the 
"ie"-syllable is in fact a diphthong. The plural of these words can be formed 
regularly (the phonological attribute 'sjwa' can be used to distinguish 
stressless "-ie" with sjwa and stressless "-ie" without sjwa.$
$ Group 14 and 15 consist of nouns ending in "-man", with plural endings "-lui"
(group 14) and "-lieden" (group 15), that come instead of "-man":
werkman-werklui, brandweerman-brandweerlieden, etc.$
$ Group 16 consists of original plural forms of loanwords, that have become 
common in Dutch. Most of the plural forms stem from Latin or Greek, but plurals
of words from other languages have been added too. For convenience sake, the 
complete group has been called "LatPlural" (=Latin Plural). The following plural
forms belong to this group:$
a. words ending in "-ma", where "-ma" changes into "-mata" (schema-schemata);
b. words ending in "-ca", "da", "ga", "ia", "la", "na", "ra", "sa", "ta", and 
   "va", which get an extra "-e" (mensa-mensae);
c. words ending in "-e"; "-e" changes into "-ia" (impersonale-impersonalia);
d. words ending in "-aal"; "-aal" changes into "-alia" (regaal-regalia);
e. words ending in "-um"; "-um" changes into "-a" (datum-data);
f. words ending in "-on"; "-on" changes into "-a" (protozoo¨"n-protozoa);
g. words ending in "-en"; "-en" changes into "-ina" (examen-examina);
h. words ending in "-o"; "-o" changes into "-i" (saldo-saldi);
i. words ending in "-or"; "-or" changes into "-ores" (pastor-pastores);
j. words ending in "-aur"; "-aur" changes into "-auri" (centaur-centauri);
k. words ending in "-uur"; "-uur" changes into "-ures" (paruur-parures);
l. words ending in "-as"; "-as" changes into "-ates" (civitas-civitates);
m. words ending in "-is"; "-is" changes into "-es" (basis-bases);
n. words ending in "-ns"; "-ns" changes into "-ntia" (reagens-reagentia);
o. words ending in "-os"; "-os" changes into "-oi" (topos-topoi);
p. words ending in "-ps"; "-ps" changes into "-pora" (corps-corpora);
q. words ending in "-rs"; "-rs" changes into "-rtes" (pars-partes);
r. words ending in "-us"; "-us" changes into "-i" (cyclus-cycli);
s. words ending in "-nt"; "-nt" changes into "-ntia" (deodorant-deodorantia)
t. words ending in "-ut"; "-ut" changes into "-ita" (caput-capita);
u. words ending in "-ex"; "-ex" changes into "-ices" (codex-codices);
v. words ending in "-ix"; "-ix" changes into "-ices" (matrix-matrices);
w. words ending in "-ox"; "-ox" changes into "-oces" (vox-voces);
x. words ending in "-ux"; "-ux" changes into "-uces" (crux-cruces).
$ Groups 17, 18 and 19 contain remaining nouns with respectivily irregular 
"-en"-plural, irregular "-s"-plural and irregular "Latin"-plurals;$
$ group 17 consists of: bamboe-bamboezen;$
$ group 18 consists of: la-laas, ra-raas, vla-vlaas, ega-egaas;$

$ One should note that it is possible that many of the groups can be 
incomplete: it is hard to
find all the nouns with a certain plural form. Often no systematic strategy is
possible except of checking each noun of the dictionary separately. Besides, in
a certain way every group of plurals is infinite: almost any noun can be used to
form compounds with. In general, the compound has the same plural form(s) as its
rightmost part has when it occurs as 'simple' noun. Thus, in the segmentation 
rules, every string starts with a '*'and no other measures have to be taken.$
$ (Basic) nouns that are plural form themselves (like "hersenen") have the value
'OnlyPlural' and of course, cannot have other plural forms; nouns that can occur
as singular only have the value 'NoPlural'. Consequently, the values
'OnlyPlural' and 'NoPlural' never combine with other values.$
$CH 5.2,Gender
$ Dutch nouns have gender; a noun can be masculine, feminine or neuter.
Masculine and feminine words have "de" as definite article, neuter words get 
"het". The information about gender is stored in the attribute "gender", with
the values: 'mnlgender' (for masculine words), 'vrgender' (for feminine words)
and 'onzgender' (for neuter words). In case the attribute "gender" is 
irrelevant, the value 'omegagender' is assigned. One should note that the gender
of a noun doesn't say anything about the genus of the person or object that is
referred to: the noun "meisje" (=girl) is neuter, whereas the person it refers
to is female.$
$ In the Dutch morphology of ROSETTA, the attribute "gender" is not used in 
conditions for nouns (but of course it _is_ copied from BNOUN to SUBNOUN and 
from SUBNOUN to NOUN, like the other inherent attributes).$
$CH 5.3,Number
$ The attribute "number" has the values: 'singular' (for singular nouns), 
'plural' (for plural nouns) and 'omeganumber' (when "number" is irrelevant).$
$CH 5.4,Genitive forms
$ The attribute "genitive" is 'true' when the noun has the genitive-form. The 
genitive in Dutch is formed by:$
$ - the ending "-s", after: "b", "c", "d", "e", "f", 
"g", "h"(but only if preceded by a consonant), "k", "l", "m", "n", "p", "q", 
"r", "t", "v", "w", "y"(but only if preceded by a vowel);$
$ - an apostrophe (after "sj", "s", "x", "z");$
$ - by "-'s" (after "a", "e¨'", "h"(but only if preceded by a vowel), "i", 
"ij", "o", "u" and "y"(but only if preceded by a consonant).$
$ The genitief suffix is marked by 'SFKgens'; examples can be found in the 
document that contains the Dutch rules.$
$ In general, only proper names (Jan, Tineke, Jans, Cruijff), words that 
express family-relations (vader, tante, ouders) or words that can be used to 
accost a person (dominee, buurman) can get genitive form in Dutch. Plural
genitive forms are rare ("mijn _ouders'_ huis", "mijn zoontjes' rapporten"),
but not impossible. Genitive of a plural form seems to be possible only when the
plural ending is a "-s": *"mijn _zonens_ rapporten", "mijn zoons' rapporten".
Therefore, the lextree-rules accept genitive forms of plurals only when the
plural is formed by (regular or irregular) s-plural.$
$NP
$CH 6,Adjectives and adverbs
$ This section is about adjectives and adverbs. All attributes are given for
adjectives; adverbs have the same attributes (with the same values), except for:
'use', 'eFormation' and 'eORenForm', which they have not.$
$CH 6.1,Form
$ The attribute "form" is an non-inherent attribute of adjectives and adverbs,
that shows the form of the adjective: positive ("verstandig"), comparative
("verstandiger"), superlative ("verstandigst") and a special type 
of superlative, the allersuperlative ("allerverstandigst"); both positive
and comparative can have a special form: sPositive ("verstandigs") and 
sComparative ("verstandigers"). Adjectives and
adverbs occur in positive-form in the dictionary; the other forms are derived
by inflectional suffixes (like: "-er" for comparatives, "-st" for superlatives, 
etc.) or by words like "meer" (for comparatives) or "meest" (for superlatives).$
$CH 6.2,Use
$ The inherent attribute "use" is used for adjectives only and tells us whether 
or not the adjective can function 'attributive'(i.e. as modifier of a noun),
'predicative'(i.e. as a subject complement) or 'nominalised'.
The distinction between these three
functions of adjectives is important because only attributively used adjectives
can get "-e" ending and only nominalised adjectives have both "-e" and "-en" 
endings (see also 6.3. and 6.6.).$
$CH 6.3,eORenForm
$ The non-inherent attribute 'eORenForm' has the values 'NoForm', 'eForm' 
and 'enForm'; it has 
'eForm' when the adjective has "-e" (like: "grote" and "grootste"),
'enForm' when it has "-en" (like in nominalised forms: "groten", "grootsten")
and 'NoForm' when it has neither "-e" nor "-en" (like: "groot" and "grootst").$ 
$CH 6.4,Comparatives
$ The attribute 'comparatives' contains information about the way the 
comparative of a adjective (or an adverb) can be formed; sometimes, adjectives 
have several comparative forms. The attribute has a set as value; this set 
contains one or more of the following values:$ 
erComp       : for regular comparatives with: '(d)er'; segm. rules with SFKer.
erIrregComp  : for irregular comparatives; segm. rules with SFKonreger.
meerComp     : for comparatives with "meer" (no special segmentation rules).
NoComp       : adjective (or adverb) doesn't have a comparative at all.
$ Examples: "leuker" is the regular comparative of "leuk" ('erComp'), "beter"
is the irregular comparative of "goed" ('erIrregComp'), "meer prive¨'" is the
'meer'-comparative of "prive¨'" ('meerComp') and adjectives like "houten", 
"gouden" do not have a comparative form ('NoComp').$
$CH 6.5,Superlatives
$ The attribute 'superlatives' contains information about the way the 
superlative of an adjective (or an adverb) can be formed; sometimes, adjectives 
have several superlative forms. The attribute has a set as value; this set 
contains one or more of the following values:$ 
stSup        : for regular superlatives with: 'st'; segm. rules with SFKst.
stIrregSup   : for irregular superlatives; segm. rules with SFKonregst. 
allerSup     : for reg. superlat. with: prefix 'aller'(SFKaller) + 'st'(SFKer).
allerIrregSup: for irregular superlatives with 'aller' and 'st'. 
meestSup     : for superlatives with "meest" (no special segmentation rules).
NoSup        : adjective (or adverb) doesn't have a superlative at all.
$ Examples: "leukst" is the regular superlative of "leuk" ('stSup'), "best"
is the irregular superlative of "goed" ('erIrregSup'), "meest prive¨'" is the
'meest'-superlative of "prive¨'" ('meestSup') and adjectives like "houten", 
"gouden" do not have a superlative form ('NoSup').$
$CH 6.6,eFormation and eNominalisation
$ The adjectives can be split into three types:$
$NL 1

$ Adjectives of the first type (groups 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9)
do not get "-e" in the positive and nominalised positive form:$
       'De mica tafel'
       'Een gouden armband'
       'Geef mij de linker maar'   (nominalised)
       'De houten is van hem'      (nominalised)
$ These groups never get comparative or superlative endings (if they do have
a comparative or a superlative, these are formed by 'meer' or 'meest').$
$ Adjectives of the second type (groups 10 and 11) do not have "-e" in the 
positive and comparative forms of the adjective in non-nominalised form:$
    de sexy     zanger         een sexier     zanger    (heb ik nooit gezien)
    de trendy   jongen         een trendier   jongen             "
    de tevreden vrouw          een tevredener vrouw              "
    de ervaren  handelaar      een ervarener  handelaar          "
$ The non-nominalised superlative of these adjectives is _with_ "-e", or can be
formed with "meest" (and, of course, the adjective is without "-e" then):$
    de sexiest_e_    zanger    (better: "meest sexy")
    de trendiest_e_  jongen    (better: "meest trendy")
    de tevredenst_e_ vrouw     (better: "meest tevreden")
    de ervarenst_e_  handelaar (also: "meest ervaren")
$ The nominalised forms are always _with_ "-e" (but not always accepted):$
    het sexy_e_(?) eraan is ...
    het trendie¨"r_e_ ervan is ...
    de tevreden_e_(n) is(zijn) er niet
    het open_e_ van zijn karakter
$ The same holds for past participles (of strong and 
irregular verbs):$
     het verborgen/*verborgene bezit        (attributive)
     het verborgene ervan ...               (nominalised)
     de  verborgenen wachtten gespannen af  (nominalised)
$ Groups 12, 13 and 14 are regular; all forms can get an "-e". A special group
is formed by group 13, that consists of words on "-e" (=sjwa): "luxe", 
"timide", etc.; these adjectives are regular, but the extra "-e" in the
positive and nominalised positive cannot stick to the stem because the stem 
ends in "-e" already; this implies that the most elegant solution
for the members of this group will be to write a segmentation rule like:$
    *e   + SFKe  :: *e, FONsjwasjwa;
$ Of course, this rule may not be applied recursively.$
$ The attributes "eFormation" and "eNominalisation" are 'false' for 
groups 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9; both attributes are 'true' for 
groups 12, 13 and 14; and "eFormation" is 'false', and "eNominalised" is 'true'
for groups 10 and 11;$
$ Note: the fact that "het sexye¨"" is accepted in Dutch, but "de sexye¨"" 
(referring to a person) seems to be unacceptable, is not considered in the 
morphology at the moment.$
$ The "-en"-ending for nominalised forms is possible whenever "eNominalisation"
is 'true': "de zekeren", "de tevredenen", "de verstandigen", etc. (the fact 
that "de sexye¨"n", "de trendye¨"n", etc. seem to be unacceptable is
(again) not considered at the moment).$
$NP
$CH 7,Other categories
$ Until now, we have seen the way the Dutch morphology deals with the main
categories: verb, noun, adjectives and adverbs. Of course, all other categories
are handled in morphology too; most of these, however, are treated trivially:
the only thing that is done, is: linking BCAT and CAT without change of form. 
In a few cases more happens than a simple linking process; in the next
sections, these categories will be paid attention to. A SUBCAT level is
not needed for other categories than verb, noun, adjectives and adverbs, 
because derivation is limited to the main categories.$
$CH 7.1,PERSPRO's
$ PERSPRO's will be derived from BPERSPRO's, which are in the dictionary; in 
Dutch, the following BPERSPRO's exist (with _inherent_ attributes: 'number', 
'gender', 'person' and, of course, 'key'):$
$NL 1
$RL 10
BPERSPRO:   number:    gender:      person:   key:

zij         meervoud, omegagender,  3,       ...
$NL 1
$ Note that some of the BPERSPRO's have the same (string)form; because the 
attribute 'number' always differs for such homonyms, it is easy to 
distinguish between them. Such homonyms also occur in forms that are derived 
from BPERSPRO's: "uw" (singular/plural), "uwe" (singular/plural), etc. As a 
consequence, suffix-keys for pronouns are split into two groups; one group
consists of suffix-keys that work for singular forms only, the other of
suffix-keys that work for plurals only.$
$ All PERSPRO's can be derived from one of these BPERSPRO's. PERSPRO's also have
two non-inherent attributes: 'case' (with the values 'nominative', 'dative' and
'accusative') and 'reduced' (with the values 'true' and 'false'). In Dutch, the
following PERSPRO's exist:$

$ Not included in the set of PERSPRO's are obsolete forms like "haar"(plural)
and forms that do not belong to standard Dutch, like "hunnie", "hullie", 
"zullie", etc.$
$ There are no rules for the relation between "het" en "zijn" resp. "haar", as
in sentences like:$
       '_Het_ ziet _zijn_ vader'
       'Het meisje beweerde dat _het_ _haar_ vader nog nooit gezien had'
$ As a consequence, the second sentence will never yield the translation:$
       'The girl asserted that _she_ had never seen _her_ father'
$ where "she" and "her" are referring to the same person. Extensions at this 
point will be needed in future versions of ROSETTA, in particular with respect 
to interactive disambiguation.$
$ "Men" has a special value for "person": 6, and has "mnlgender" because it
corresponds to "zijn" and "z'n". Because there are no POSSADJ's "zijn" or "z'n"
that are derived from "men", the fact that "men" and "zijn" refer to the same
group in the sentence:$
       'Men respectere zijn ouders'
$ has to be handled by special rules in the M-grammar.
Note that "men" has as special property that it can have "elkaar" in sentences
like:$
       'Men ziet elkaar'
$ "Gij" has nominative forms only; these are used in analysis (only). The 
accusative
and dative forms of "gij", as well as the from "gij" derived POSSADJ's, are the
same as for "u"; in all these cases, however, we will analyse them as forms of 
"u" _only_, because forms with "gij" are not very usual in Dutch. In generation,
only "u" and derived forms of "u" will be made. For POSSADJ's, this approach
may lead to problems for sentences like:$
       'Gij kunt uw kinderen dagelijks bezoeken'
$ where "gij" and "uw" refer to the same person, and "uw" is a bound anaphor. 
Special rules in the M-grammar should handle this type of sentences.$
$ The difference between reduced forms and non-reduced forms is important
because of the fact that reduced forms often can be used generic, as the 
following sentences illustrate:$
      'In Scheveningen kun je Engeland zien liggen'     {"je"  = subject}
      'In Scheveningen kunnen ze Engeland zien liggen'  {"ze"  = subject}
      'Ze ontslaan je hier zomaar'                      {"je"  = object}
      'Men gooit ze er daar zomaar uit'                 {"ze"  = object}
$ "Men" can only be used generic, and it seems that "men" is limited to 
subject-function:$
      'In Scheveningen kan men Engeland zien liggen'    {"men" = subject}
$ For reasons of efficiency, all attributes of BPERSPRO's 
(and the attribute-values) will be copied to the PERSPROrecord in the lextree
rules.$
$CH 7.2,POSSADJ's

non-inherent categories: 'reduced' (with values: 'true', 'false'), 
'eForm' (with: 'true' and 'false'), 'mood' (with: 'wh', 
'declarative') and 'genitive' (with: 'true', 'false'). The attributes of the 
B-categories under the POSSADJ's (BPERSPRO, BWHPRO, BDEMPRO) will never be 
copied to the POSSADJ-level.$

$ Note: the BWHPRO and BDEMPRO, that are 'under' the POSSADJ, have attributes
"natgeslacht" (that gives information about the gender of the 
person the POSSADJ refers to) and the attribute "number": the value 'mannelijk'

the value 'vrouwelijk' combined with 'singular' or 'plural' and the value 
'mannelijk' or '[]' combined with 'plural' yield "wier" as BWHPRO. If these

non-inherent attribute 'nvorm', with the values: 'true', 'false'.

attributes have to be evaluated, one has to traverse the tree to the 
BCAT-level.$
$CH 7.3.1,nvorm

jouwe (from: jij), uwe (from: u), zijne (from: hij), hare (from: zij), 
onze (from: wij), uwe (from: u(=plural)), hunne (from: zij).$
$ The value 'true' for: mijnen (from: ik), jouwen (from: jij), uwen (from: u), 
zijnen (from: hij), haren (from: zij), onzen (from: wij), 
uwen (from: u(=plural)), hunnen (from: zij).$
$ There is no POSSPRO (irrespective of the value of 'nvorm') that corresponds
with the BPERSPRO "jullie". Here, we need a paraphrase. (Compare 7.2., POSSADJ's
in genitive form).$

$CH 8,future changes
$ In this section, some remarks will be made about the changes that can or 
should be made in the future. Some of these remarks deal with problems or
gaps in the coverage of the Dutch morphology which were faced after the work
on the rules had been finished.$
$ The following _verbs_ cannot be handled by the spelling rules because
they don't have vowel reduction in present plural forms, conjunctive and 
infinitive, like in 'normal' Dutch verbs: "carpoolen", "croonen", 
"freewheelen", "inzoomen", "keepen", "poolen", "screenen", "uitzoomen", 
"zoomen" (list derived from vanDale's alfabetical section). 
If we consider these verbs as 'irregular' (conjugationclass 1 or 2), this
problem can easily be dealt with, because all inflected forms of the irregular
verbs are 'listed' in the segmentation rules.$
$ In the present ordering of rules, the combination of 'ablaut' _and_ 
"-t"-ending is impossible, because the segmentation rules for 
both phenomena are in the same set of 
suffix rules (namely the non-recursive set). Therefore the past 'gij'-form of
ablauted verbs, like "gij riept", "gij vondt" (see: ANS, 8.3.2.10) cannot be 
generated or analysed. This problem can be solved by moving the 'ablaut'-rules
from the set of non-recursive suffix rules to the set of 
freefix-rules.$
$ The choice for the value '6' for the attribute 'person' for "men", as is
presented in section 7.1, is still in discussion; therefore the lextree rules
are left as they were before this choice was considered. As a consequence, 
there is a inconsistency between the documentation in section 7 and the rules
themselves; the rules must be changed 
if "men" (eventually) indeed gets the value 'persons=6':
all rules for verbforms that fit for "men" then need '6' in the set of 
'persons'.$
$ Another document deals with derivational suffixes; among these is the
_diminutive_ suffix (as in: "klein_tje_", but also in: "warm_pjes_"). Of
course, this implies that diminutives are not considered to be an inflectional
phenomena.$
