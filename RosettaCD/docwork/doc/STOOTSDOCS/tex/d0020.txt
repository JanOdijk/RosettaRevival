\section{Introduction}
This document gives a short description of some implementation aspects of the
dictionaries that are used in Rosetta2. A more theoretical description of the
dictionaries is to be found in "Dictionaries in Rosetta2" (R15).


\subsection{What is a dictionary}
In the definition of Rosetta2 some sets and functions are specified that are
implemented by means of extensive enumeration. Some of these enumerations are
not part of the source of the Rosetta2 program, but are kept in seperate files.
These files we will call dictionaries.


\subsection{Which dictionaries exist}
In accordance with R15 the following dictionaries exist :
\begin{description}
\item[B-LEX]
Because every language has its own B-LEX, it is quite likely that in the
Rosetta2 program two different B-LEX's are used, so to resolve name conflicts
we use {\bf ABLEX} to refer to the B-LEX of the source language, and 
{\bf GBLEX} to refer
to the target language's B-LEX. In case the source and target language are the
same both names refer to the same dictionary.

\item[A-TR$_{\rm B}$]
This dictionary is called {/bf ATDICT}. As said in R15 a meaning key may have a
description coupled to it so that in case of an ambiguous translation of a
basic-expression the different meanings of this basic-expression can be made
clear to the user. This is done in the interaction mode, so that the user can
desambiguate. Only for some meaning keys this facility is used (for
instance 'wife'-meaning-key, 'queen'-meaning-key and 'woman'-meaning-key, these
are the different meanings of the Dutch 'vrouw', all have a description linked
to it), so at least we could test the desambiguing process.
For historical reasons this file still contains for each IL-key the number
of its arguments, as wel as their expexted types.

\item[G-TR$_{\rm B}$]
This dictionary is called {\bf GTDICT}.

For historical reasons this file too contains for each IL-key the number
of its arguments, as wel as their expexted types.

\item[TypeList]
We have used three files to implement this one. For every basic meaning key
its corresponding type is given in the file with the logical name {\bf EigenType}
(Dutch for 'OwnType'), and the types of its arguments (only in case of a
function) is listed in the file with the logical name {\bf VerwachteType} (Dutch
for 'ExpectedType'). Both these files have also a short description of the
meaning of each basic meaning key (helas these discriptions are not such that
they can be used to fill ATDICT, besides they are all in Dutch), and also for
each key the number of arguments is defined here.

For historical reasons the dictionary EigenType is included in the source
(it there for is not a real dictionary, allthough it should). In order to not let
explode the size of the program we made a smaller version of it. This third
file is referred to with the logical name {\bf TypeDef}.

The content of VerwachteType should correspond with the content of ATDICT
and GTDICT. The update utilities take care of this.

\item[A-MDICT]
This one is called {\bf AMDICT}.

\item[G-MDICT]
This one is called {\bf GMDICT}.

\item[A-IRR-LEX]
This one is unfortunately called {\bf AIRBLEX}, reflecting the fact that it is
implemented in the same way as the B-LEX dictionary.

\item[G-IRR-LEX]
For the same reason as above-mentioned this one is called {\bf GIRBLEX}.

\item[A-ID-LEX]
This dictionary is called {\bf AIDIOM}.

\item[G-ID-LEX]
This dictionary is called {\bf GIDIOM}.
\end{description}


A seperate dictionary for the basic meanings of IL is not maintained,
because the information that should be in it is already contained in TypeList.

In order to be able to adjust the language used in the interaction mode, all
the sentences used there are put in a file. This file too we call a dictionary,
it has got the logical file name {\bf Comment}.


\section{Several views on the dictionaries}
\subsection{The use within Rosetta2}
\subsubsection{The representation}
Mathematical spoken a dictionary is a set of tuples. This can easily be
represented by a sequence of tuples, and a simple implementation of a sequence
is a file. A tuple can be thought of as a record structure, so a simple and
straight forward implementation of a dictionary would be a record structured
file. This has however a disadvantage, namely that Pascal provides no means at
all to access a file as a random access file nor as an indexed sequential file,
restricting the possible search algoritmes in an untolerable way.
By fixing the number of tuples in a dictionary it becomes possible to use an
array to implement it. All kinds of access are easily simulated on an array.
That is why within the Rosetta2 program all the dictionaries are implemented
as arrays.

\subsubsection{The initialisation fase}
Because the program uses arrays to represent the dictionaries, the use of
dictionaries in the program must be preceeded by the initialisation of
these arrays.

This initialisation process takes quite some time, and there for it is
preferable to do it only once. That is why the initialisation of the
dictionaries is not part of the procedures ANALYSIS and GENERATION, but is put
in the global procedures InitAnLexica and InitGenLexica.
The corresponding dictionaries for different languages resemble each other so
much that it is quite a burden to look after it that no name conflicts arise
when the an- and genlexica are defined whithin the same scope. There for the
structural
definition of an/gen-lexica and the actions upon those structures
had to be put in seperate modules.

\subsection{A deficiency in the implementation}
The fact that the search actions in some dictionaries (like AMDICT) are
heavily interwoven with the parse algoritme makes it cumbersome to change the
choosen implementation of the dictionaries. It would have been better if we had
used the principle of abstract data types more thorougly troughout the
program.

\subsection{The long term storage}
All dictionaries are stored on disk as files.

For all the dictionaries but AIRBLEX, GIRBLEX and BLEX the only way to update
the dictionary is to use the VAX/VMS editor. This makes it necessary that the
dictionaries are in the form of normal text files. The use of these files to
fill the dictionary-arrays would slow down the initialisation process to much,
there for most of these text files are translated into Pascal record structured
files, and these latter files are the files used by the program.
For AIRBLEX, GIRBLEX and BLEX only a Pascal record structured file is
maintained, and through the use of a special update facility it is possible to
inspect and alter these dictionary files. As there is no corresponding text
file for these dictionaries it is necessary that the update program and these
dictionaries 'fit' together, see also the section on external consistency.
In appendix A the names of all the dictionary files are given and in appendix
B the structure of the directory in which the dictionary files are kept is
explained.

\subsection{The updating}
For B-LEX, A-IRR-LEX and G-IRR-LEX a special update utility is develloped,
this utility makes it easy to change attributes, add new entries or remove old
ones.  As long as the definitions of the Pascal record structures remain the
same this is a very simple process, but when they too change it becomes a
little more complex. See appendix E for an elaborated example.

All the other dictionaries have to be changed by editing the text version of
the dictionary in question with a normal text editor. After changes have been
made in A-MDICT, G-MDICT, A-TR$_{\rm B}$ or G-TR$_{\rm B}$
they should be made available to
the Rosetta2 program by means of some special utilities (TextToAMDict,
TextToGMDict, TextToATDict and TextToGTDict). This is necessary as the Rosetta2
program uses Pascal record structured versions of these dictionary files.

In appendix C a short discription of the implementation of the utility
programs is given and appendix D may serve as a short user manual for these
utilities, in appendix E some examples are given.


\subsection{The creation}
Not much is to be said about the creation of the dictionaries. We used some
algoritmes to gues the attribute values of the entries in BLEX, but a lot of
guesses were wrong and I think it is difficult to improve the guessing much.
So when ever a new dictionary must be created, a lot of time will be involved
in filling the attributes.


\subsection{The consistency problem}
The consistency of the dictionaries is quite a complex problem. I will
introduce some terms here and describe the consistency problem using these
new terms believing that this might be helpfull to tackle the
problem in the future.

To start with we can distinguish the so called {\bf internal} from the
{\bf external} consistency. The internal consistency itself can be seen as 
{\bf intra}-
and {\bf inter}- dictionary consistency.

\subsubsection{Internal consistency}
We can look upon the dictionaries as constituting a database. A database is
just a collection of files, dependencies between these files and restrictions
upon the content of these files (see de Brock : Database models and retrieval
languages).
When all the dependencies between the database files are obeyed we call the
database {\bf inter dictionary consistent}. We will call a database file {\bf
intra
dictionary consistent} when it obeys the restrictions put on the file in
isolation.

\subsubsection{Intra dictionary consistency}
The database files that we use are sorted sets of attribute tuples. As is
usual in a database the range of values for every attribute is restricted, and
also the possible combinations of attribute values within one tuple are
restricted. Besides for every database file a non empty set of keys must be
defined; any set of attributes, that uniquely defines every entry of the
database file and contains no proper subset that does the same, may serve as a
key.
A dictionary is normaly an ordered set of tuples; one can argue whether this
ordening attributes to the external consistency or to the intra dictonary
consistency, I have a slide preference for the latter.
There for the intra dictionary consistency is expressed 1) by a constraint
concerning the sorting of the file, 2) by constraints concerning the possible
values of an attribute (attribute constraints), and 3) by constraints concerning
the possible combinations of attribute values within one tuple (tuple
constraints).
It is often possible to express the attribute constraints by using the Pascal
subrange mechanisme, but this fails in case the attribute constraint is such
that the attribute value may be any value that lies within a series of non
consecutive subranges.

Nothing is done yet to test any but the most simple attribute constraints.


\subsubsection{Inter dictionary consistency}
A database constrain is a global constrain on the possible values of the files 
of the database.
In order to relate the database files a special kind of database constraint, namely
a set of so called attribute transformations, has to be formulated.
An attribute transformation defines a mapping between sets of attributes of
different database files; entries from the different database files are related
if and only if they have the same values for the attributes thus mapped. In 
this way so called 'keys' can be defined.

None of the datebase constrains are checked in the current
implementation.

\smallskip
The nice form of the Rosetta dictionary structure is displayed in the
following picture. In this picture "LEX$_{\rm 1}$-(n-m)$->$ LEX$_{\rm 2}$"
means that such an attribute transformation is defined that
n entries in LEX$_{\rm 1}$ corresponds with m entries in LEX$_{\rm 2}$.

\begin{verbatim}
AM-DICT    (n-1)    A-ID-LEX

 (n-1)     (n-1)         (n-1)

A-IRR-LEX                                A-TR


              (n-1)                 (n-m)     (n-1)

                               B-LEX               TypeList

              (1-n)                 (m-n)     (1-n)

G-IRR-LEX                                G-TR


 (1-n)     (1-n)         (1-n)

GM-DICT    (1-n)    G-ID-LEX
\end{verbatim}

To every language the same picture applies. In all these pictures only
TypeList refers to the same physical dictionary file.

\subsubsection{External consistency}
This is a very trivial kind of consistency. It pinnpoints the problem of
having a program that manipulates the dictionaries, but lacking the garantee
that the dictionary really is structured like the program thinks it is.

The dictionaries are Pascal files of a certain record type. This record type
is also used in the program for the dictionary access. It is obvious that any
change in this record type will have the effect that dictionaries and program
won't fit together any more. Also a change in the ordering of a dictionary will
most likely account for a mismatch between the dictionary file and the
program.
By splitting off the so called lexical source we isolated the software that
is responsible for the dictionary access and definition. Any change in this
source may have the effect that the dictionaries and the program don't fit
together, which means that dictionaries become unreadable, so care has to
be taken in doing so.

\section{THE DIRECTORIES}
\subsection{THE LOGICAL DIRECTORY NAMES}
Here all the logical names for directories are listed in alphabetic order.
The following information is given for each logical directory name :

{\bf DIRECTORY} gives the translation of the logical directory name. First the
names used for the demonstration version are given, then the names used in the
work version. The utilities used in developing Rosetta2 take care off
assigning the correct translation to the logical directory name. For
information concerning these utilities see "Utilities for Rosetta2"
(R19).

{\bf USE} gives a short discription of the files contained in the directory.

\subsection{THE DIRECTORY TREE}
The directory structure for the dictionary directories is in picture form
like this:


{\bf demo version}
\begin{verbatim}
                            [Rosetta]
                                |
                             [.WB2]
                               / \
                          [.IL]   [.taal]
                                   /  |         \
                            [.BLEX]  [.AIRBLEX]  [.GIRBLEX]

\end{verbatim}
{\bf work version}
\begin{verbatim}
                            [taal]
                                |
                             [.WB2]
                               / \
                          [.IL]   [.taal]
                                   /  |         \
                            [.BLEX]  [.AIRBLEX]  [.GIRBLEX]
\end{verbatim}
In this picture {\em taal} stands for one of the following strings "Dutch", 
"WorkDutch", "English" and "WorkEngli".

\section{The Disk}
In this implementation of Rosetta2 three logical Disks are used, but only one
physical Disk. It is possible however to use a special Disk on which all the
dictionary files are put without having to redesign all of Rosetta2. A simple
redefinition of the logical WBDisk will suffice.


Below the logical WBDisk is defined.

{\bf DISK} gives the translation of the logical disk name. This logicals is
created in the group logical name table at VAX/VMS system startup, for then
the command file "ROSDisk:[Rosetta]initroset.com" is automatically executed.

{\bf USE} gives a short
discribtion of the kind of things to be found on the disk.


\subsection{WBDisk                  dictionary Disk}
\begin{description}
\item[DISK] \_\_DRB0:
\item[USE] On this Disk all the dictionary files are kept, the Pascal
              readable file as well as the corresponding text files.
              So all the things kept in the subdirectory called "[.WB2]"
              belong on this disk.
\end{description}

\section{The implementation of the update utilities}
The update program includes updateprocs, deleteswitch, insertswitch,
editswitch, listswitch, irblexupdateprocs, leestype, schrijftype, minmaxtype
and vrijeplaatsenswitch. All these included files are kept in LS directories.


\section{The use of the update facilities}
All the update utilities are such that it is necessary to be logged in as
the user that 'owns' the dictionaries you want to update. If you only want to
inspect BLEX,AIRBLEX and GIRBLEX then you can use the update-program anywhere.


\subsection{What to do. (a dicision tree)}
{\em void}

\subsection{update}
The update program is activated by typing the command "update {\em taal}", in
which {\em taal} stands for one of the following strings "Dutch", "WorkDutch",
"English" and "WorkEnglish".



{\bf syntax of an update-command :}
\begin{verbatim}
 opdracht  :: range command {qualifier}.
 range     :: [bkey | bkey "," bkey | categorie | "*"] [":" wbsoort].
 bkey      :: natuurlijk-getal.
 categorie :: categorie-naam.
 wbsoort   :: "AIRBLEXwb" | "BLEXwb" | "GIRBLEXwb".
 command   :: list | edit | delete | insert | vrij |
              stringtokey | show   | nop    |
              exit | stop | abort.
 qualifier :: "-" qualstring | veld-naam.
 qualstring:: infile | outfile | veld.
 infile    :: "i" file-naam}.
 outfile   :: "o" file-naam}.
 veld      :: "v" veld-naam}.
\end{verbatim}

{\bf semantics of an update-command :}
The default command is "nop", the qualifiers receive their default
values again at the start of each command, range however remains its value.
Every command may be abbreviated as long as the abbreviation is unambigues.

\begin{description}
\item[range ]
The value of range determines wich entries of the dictionaries are to be
treated by the command. The lowerbound of the specified reange should exist,
for the upperbound the minimum of the specified upperbound and the upperbound
corresponding to the category in which the specified lowerbound lies is used.

A "*" means that the command is meant to work on the whole dictionary.


\item[command ]
With 'command' you specify the kind of command you want. No command
is the same as the "nop" command, a "?" is the same as the "help" command.


\item[qualifier ]
With the aid of qualifiers you can adjust the working of a command. If you
specify the same qualifier more than once in the same command, then the latest
specified value is used.


\item[bkey ]
This is the basickey.


\item[categorie ]
This is the syntactic categery.


\item[list ]
The  "list" command gives a listing of all the entries that lie within the
specified range.


\item[edit ]
The "edit" command let you change all the entries that lie within th]
specified range. During the editing of the different fields of an entry
gives "?" a list of all the values that are possible for that field, a
simple "{\em cr}" lets the value of the field unchanged.


\item[delete ]
The "delete" command removes all the entries that lie within the
specified range from the dictionaries.


\item[insert ]
The "insert" command fills the specified range with new entries, old entries
are not removed. A new entry gets a default value for all its fields, and then
the possibility to change these fields is offered. Again a "?" gives a  list of
all the values that are possible for the field, a simple "{\em cr}" lets the value
of the field unchanged.

\item[vrij ]
The "vrij" command shows what keys in the specified range are unused.


\item[stringtokey ]
The "StringToKey" let you find the key(s) associated with a certain string.
If you didn't use the veldnaam qualifier, then you are asked for the string.


\item[save ]
The "save" command makes all the changes that you have made uptil now
permanent. It is advisable to use this command now and again to protect
one self for loosing all the changes in case the program aborts due to
incorrect command input.


\item[help ]
The "help" command gives on line information about the update program,
this information is not always up to date, so it is better to stick to
the information given here.


\item[stop ]
The "stop" command makes all the changes permanent and stops the program. It
is equivalent with the "exit" command.


\item[abort ]
The "abort" command simply stops the program and the changes that you made
since the start of the progam or the latest "save" command are lost.


\item[exit ]
The "exit" command makes all the changes permanent and stops the program. It
is equivalent with the "stop" command.


\item[nop ]
The "nop" command has no action associated with it. The empty command has
the same effect.


\item[infile ]
If infile is specified, then during command processing the input is read from
the specified file. The terminal is the default.


\item[outfile ]
If outfile is specified, then during command processing the output is written
to the specified file. The terminal is the default.


\item[veld ]
This qualifier restricts the working of the command to the specified field
of the entries. An empty string means all the fields, this is the default
value.


\item[show ]
The "show" command shows the value of range for the current dictionary kind,
when the veldnaam qualifier equals "*", then the full value of range is
listed.

\subsection{TextTo?MDict and ?MDictToText}
Here the TextToAMdict, AMdictToText, TextToGMdict and GMdictToText utilities
are described.

To make a Pascal record structured file of AMDICT one should give the command
"TextToAMDict {\em taal}", in which {\em taal} stands for one of the following strings
"Dutch",  "WorkDutch",  "English"  and "WorkEnglish". For efficienty reasons
the utility AMDictToText is created, this utility makes a text file out of the
Pascal  record  structured  file.  This makes it possible to throw away the
text version as soon as changes are saved in the Pascal record structured file
and  thus  save  on  disk  space.  One is advised to use this facility with
utmost  care  as it is possible to 'forget' changes to AMDICT when they are
not yet saved.

For GMDict one should just substitute "GMDict" in stead of "AMDict" in this
section.


\subsection{TextTo?TDict and ?TDictToText}
Here the TextToATDict, ATDictToText, TextToGTDict and GTDictToText utilities
are described.

To make a Pascal record structured file of ATDICT one should give the command
"TextToATDict {\em taal}", in which {\em taal} stands for one of the following strings
"Dutch",  "WorkDutch",  "English"  and "WorkEnglish". For efficienty reasons
the utility ATDictToText is created, this utility makes a text file out of the
Pascal  record  structured  file.  This makes it possible to throw away the
text version as soon as changes are saved in the Pascal record structured file
and  thus  save  on  disk  space.  One is advised to use this facility with
utmost  care  as it is possible to 'forget' changes to ATDICT when they are
not yet saved.

For GTDict one should just substitute "GTDict" in stead of "ATDict" in this
section.


\subsection{CommentMaker}
 This  program  makes  it  possible  to  change  the current value of the
interaction dictionary. In order to run it one should type "CommentMaker
{\em taal}".
