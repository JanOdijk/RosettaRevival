$c1 Introduction.
This note provides standards and guidelines for the 
production, storage, distribution and modification of documents.
The note is a slightly revised version of document 0002 of Project
415-A+ by E.A.M. Odijk.
$nl 1
The extent and duration of the project forces to establish means
for the organisation and control of information, which is an
important product of the project.
$nl 
The following requirements have been formulated by E.A.MM. Odijk 
for the standards
and the information system:
$um

 - all the different forms of information which
   are important for the project should be comprised. 
 - uniformity of the various documents should be stimulated.
 - they should not form a barrier for the user to apply them
   to the information s/he produces
 - they should assist to make modifications of documents carefully,
   but without involving too much delay.
 - in case of a modification of a document which interferes with
   other parts of the project, consistency should be reestablished
   sufficiently fast.

$qm
$np
$c1 Document organisation.
$c2 Preferred contents.
All documents must contain the following item:
$um

    * Documentation control (see section 2.2)



$qm
The following checklist provides items that may be applicable.
$nl
If necessary, contents of specific categories of documents
may be specified in more detail elsewhere.
$um

    * Table of contents.

    * Applicable documents.

    * Subject. 
       A short description of the subject of the document.
    
    * Page control.
       An extensive list of page numbers and the date of
       their last edition (in case of distribution of
       parts of documents )

    * Rationale.
       A statement on the reason for production of the document.
  
    * Survey of the topic under investigation.
       Questions raised, answers looked for.
 
    * Interaction with other system parts.

    * Evaluation and proposals for decisions.

$qm
$np
$c2 Lay-out.
The _document control_ page should contain the following items
in the order indicated below.
$um

    * project identification :   "Rosetta"

    * topic                  :   see 2.6
            
    * title                  :   author's choice  

    * Author                 :   name(s) of the author(s)
 
    * document code          :   see 2.3

    * date                   :   release date of the document

    * status                 :   see 2.4

    * supersedes             :   doc.numbers (if different from the
                                 present one) and 
                                 release date of document(s) which 
                                 is/are superseded by the new one.

    * distribution           :   see 2.5 

    * clearance              :   see 2.5

    * keywords               :   to be determined by the author(s)

Furthermore each page should contain the following items:

    * project identification :   "Rosetta"

    * document code          :   see 2.3

    * date                   :   release date of the document

    * page number 

If the document is a modified version of another document, the changes
may be indicated by:

    * modification marks     :   lines that have been changed,
                                 are marked in the marginal line.

The program "docman" should be used to get the right lay-out of the
document control page and the page headings.
$NP
$qm
$c2 Document code.
Documents will be sequentially numbered with  4-digit numbers.
These numbers will be issued by the project office. In
practice a number for a new document can be obtained by calling
the program "docman".
$nl
$np
$c2 Status,approval and modification.
$c3 Status.
Documents can have the following status :

$um
    * informal    ( reflection of ideas, remarks etc. 
                   informal paper without approval procedure )   

    * concept      ( official project document, offered
                    for discussion and approval )

    * approved    ( consolidated project document ,
                    reflects present state of affairs )
                    
$qm
$c3 Approval and modification.
$nl
The following procedure holds for approval and modification
of each category:
$um

    * informal    appr. : not necessary.
                  mod.  : free
   
    * concept     appr. : approval group for subject
                  mod.  : free 

    * approved    appr. : not applicable
                  mod.  : change request 

$qm
_approval groups_
$nl
The approval group of a concept document should decide on the approval
of the document. For the time being, the approval group is assumed
to be identical to the distribution group (see 2.5).
Minutes are approved by those present at the next meeting of
the same group. 
$nl 
In the future it may be necessary to write an official protocol for
informing the project office that the
status of the document should be changed to approved. For the time
being it seems sufficient that the author informs the project office
about this, after consultation of the approval group.
$nl 1
Upon delivery of a document to the project office, 
the author will indicate which approval group is appropriate. The
default approval group is the complete project team.
$nl 1
When a change request has been submitted, the approval group
should decide within four weeks. A short protocol fixes the status.
$nl
The author may wish to provide the rationale for changes in
a separate document.
$nl
(Later on, a more detailed procedure concerning change requests may
be worked out)
$np
$c2 Distribution and clearance. 
Documents have any of the following distribution classes, to be
determined by the author:
$um

    *  a sub-group :   to be denoted by the name of the group (if the project
                       office knows the members), or an explicit list of 
                       persons

    *  project     :   all team members

$qm
Lists of each category are maintained by the project office.
The project office will copy and distribute documents to
those on the list.
$nl
The project leader will receive a copy of all documents. The group leader
will receive a copy of all documents with status approved.
$nl 1
Upon request, documents may also be forwarded to persons which
are not on the distribution list,provided they belong to the
category for which clearance has been given.
The following categories can be distinguished:
$um

    *  project       (default for approved documents)

    *  Philips       (default for informal and concept documents)

    *  World         (for manuscripts; in this case the author should start
                      the Research Labs manuscript approval procedure)

$c2 Topic
$qm 
This document provides only information about the bureaucratic aspects
of the documentation, not about the structure as regards content. The
item topic is an exception to this. It assumes that for the time being
the documents are classified into 4 main groups:
$um
    
    *  Rosetta2      (for documents relating to the already existing
                      system Rosetta2)
    *  Rosetta3

    *  Rosetta4

    *  General       (for documents that are not related to one particular
                      system; minutes of progress meetings will always
                      have topic = general)

$qm
$np
$c1 Production.
Authors are free to produce their documents in any way or with any
tools they prefer, but a strong preference is expressed here 
for VAX/VMS textfiles which are processable by LIA.
$c1 Storage.
Documents will be stored, on paper, by the project office.
A set of the valid version of all documents, will be kept
accessible to all members of the project.
Previous versions will also be stored by the project office.
$nl
If documents have been prepared on the VAX/VMS system, the
textfiles should also be forwarded to and stored by the project 
office. They should be sent to the project office by means
of the instruction:
$nl
mail <filename> stoots
$c1 Retrieval.
The project office will maintain a retrieval system containing all
information of the documents, as discussed here, and references
to the location of storage of the documents.
$nl
This system will offer facilities to retrieve documents by
various entries, such as : author, keywords and items from the 
title.
$nl
This system will be accessible to all members of the project.
Originals of documents will not be forwarded.
$np
$a1 Checklist for the project office.
$um

Upon reception of a document:

  * check the document control page,
   
  * check the document's status,
     "approved": for the time being, the author informs the project office
                 about the approval, later on a protocol of the approval 
                 group may be required
     "concept" : must be recorded for future approval 
  
  * record the approval group (= distribution group),

  * distribute the document to those on the list, including the project
    leader and for approved documents the group leader,

  * store the document (and its computer version) in the valid set,

  * store the superseded document in the background set,
     and mark by which document is has been superseded, 

  * add the document information to the retrieval system,

Upon reception of a change request:

  * record the document as concept, for approval within four weeks

  * notify the approval group
